        He specializes in the history of Russian cinema and television, specifically in the periods of destalinization in the 1950s-1960s and contemporary cinema and television. He is especially interested in cultural history and memory of Soviet cinema and television. His book, <i>Inherited Discourse: The Paradigms of Stalinist Culture in Literature and Cinema of the Thaw</i> (–êcademic Project, 2007) examined cultural politics of a failed destalinization in the 1950s and 60s. An edited volume, <i>Cinemasaurus: Russian Film in Contemporary Context</i> (co-edited with Nancy Condee and Elena Prokhorova, Academic Studies Press, 2020) examined contemporary Russian cinema as a new visual economy, emerging over three decades after the Soviet collapse in 1991.  He is currently working on a broad study of genres of Russian and East European television.

        Always Marry an April Girl
        <br>
        Praise the spells and bless the charms,
        <br>
        I found April in my arms.
        <br>
        April golden, April cloudy,
        <br>
        Gracious, cruel, tender, rowdy;
        <br>
        April soft in flowered languor,
        <br>
        April cold with sudden anger,
        <br>
        Ever changing, ever true --
        <br>
        I love April, I love you.
