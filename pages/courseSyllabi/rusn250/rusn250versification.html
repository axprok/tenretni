    </p>

<h4>Trochaic Foot</h4>
<p>
Trochee is a type of metrical foot consisting of two syllables—the first is stressed and the second is an unstressed syllable. The pattern reads as “LAD-der.” 
<br>
A line of poetry with this type of foot has a trochaic meter. 
<br>
Alexander Pushkin wrote "Tale of Tsar Saltan" (1831) in trochaic tetrameter.
<br>
Tetrameter means that in one poetic line of this poetic fairy tale there are four trochaic feet.
