A poet’s pale and glaring head,

A parrot's screech, a monkey's chatter,

And profanation of the dead.

<h4>Pyrrhic foot: xx </h4>

<p>
pyrrhic foot is a foot that consists of two unstressed sylables.
    </p>

<h4>Trochaic Foot: Xx</h4>
<p>
Trochee is a type of metrical foot consisting of two syllables—the first is stressed and the second is an unstressed syllable. The pattern reads as “LAD-der.” 
<br>
A line of poetry with this type of foot has a trochaic meter. 
<br>
Alexander Pushkin wrote "Tale of Tsar Saltan" (1831) in trochaic tetrameter.
<br>
Tetrameter means that in one poetic line of this poetic fairy tale there are four trochaic feet.
<br>

<p>
    
Three young maidens sat one night 
<br>
X x | X x | X x | X
<br>
Spinning in the window-bight. 
<br>
X x | x x | X x | X

<!-- "If I were the Tsar's elected," 
One of these young maids reflected, 
"I would spread a festive board 
For all children of the Lord." 
"If I were the Tsar's eles,ted," 
Her young sister inter[ected, 
"I'd weave linen cloth to spare 
For all people everywhere." 
"Had. I been the Tsar's elected," 
Said the third, "I'd have expected 
Soon to bear our father Tsar 
A young hero famed afar." -->
