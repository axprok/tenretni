Repin painted this work in Paris.  He formulated the idea of his painting in his letter to Vladimir Stasov: "The naive and inexperienced Sadko is enchanted, but keeps his promise to the holy man to choose the girl who comes last, the Russian peasant girl. You can see that the idea is not the most original one, but it reflects my current state of mind, and maybe even the state of all Russian art, such as it is."
