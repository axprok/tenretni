<p>
There are four crucifixes in the picture, including the large pectoral cross on a gold chain. The tsar is fully bearded, for, as the Moscow Church Council of 1551 declared, "the sacred rules to all Orthodox Chnstians warn them not to shave their beards or moustaches or to cut their hair." Shaving was "a Lattn [i.e., Catholic] and heretical bequest" and men who shaved rendered themselves "unrecognizable as Christians." (cited in Hughes "From Tsar to Emperor" (54))
