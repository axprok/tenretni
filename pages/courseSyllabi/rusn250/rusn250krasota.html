<h3>Krasota or Volia</h3>

<div class="moi">
This is a maiden's headdress called Krasota.
It is open in the back so that the girl's braid would be visible,
and it was worn by Russian girls before they got married.
Part of the wedding ritual was the removal of this headdress
in preparation for the married woman's headdress, which
usually covered all of the woman's hair.  During this ritual 
the bride sang songs about her Krasota and how she did not
want to part with it, but by the end of the ritual the bride
usually passed her Krasota on to a younger relative - a sister,
sister-in-law, or niece.
