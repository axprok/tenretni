<p>discussion of Gail Lenhoff's  <a href="lenhoffBookReview.pdf">theory of Sitz im Leben</a>(vertical link of the text to the institutions that needed it).</p>

</p>

<p>
Sitz im Leben is an approach common in Biblical criticism.  It stands for the context in which a text, or object, has been created, and its function and purpose at that time. The Sitz im Leben is also used to refer to the social, ethnic and cultural setting of a site at a particular era.
