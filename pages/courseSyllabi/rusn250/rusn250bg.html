<h4>The Lives of SS Boris and Gleb</h4>

<p>Here is a discussion of Gail Lenhoff's  <a href="lenhoffBookReview.pdf">theory of Sitz im Leben</a>(vertical link of the text to the institutions that needed it).</p>

</p>

<p>
Sitz im Leben is an approach common in Biblical criticism.  It stands for the context in which a text, or object, has been created, and its function and purpose at that time. The Sitz im Leben is also used to refer to the social, ethnic and cultural setting of a site at a particular era.

<p>
The original account appears in the Primary Chronicle.
<br>
A more likely candidate as author is Sylvester of Kiev,
<br>hegumen (abbot) of the St. Michael's Monastery in Vydubychi (a village near Kyiv), 
<br>who may have compiled several sources in the year 1116 (See <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050213073343/http://hudce7.harvard.edu/~ostrowski/pvl/intro8.pdf">Donald Ostrowski and David Birnbaum</a>)
