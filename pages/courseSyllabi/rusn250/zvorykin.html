    Born and schooled in Moscow, Zvorykin is best-known for his illustrations of Russian folk tales.  After the Russian revolution, he emigrated to Paris where continued his artistic career.  His life and style were so close to Ivan Bilibin's that some critics called Zvorykin as "Moscow Bilibin." He translated into French and illustrated Russian folk tales in the 1930s. This collection was not published until it  was found by Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in 1970s. She edited them and eventually published them as <i>The Firebird and other Russian Fairy Tales</i>.  Zvorykin also designed porcelain tiles with fairy tale motifs for a German company.
