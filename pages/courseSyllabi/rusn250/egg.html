<p>During the reign of Alexander III (1881-1894), Russia experienced a period of revivalism in art, particularly in the form of Russian Revival architecture and the Russian Arts and Crafts Movement. This revival was driven by a desire to assert Russian national identity and celebrate historical heritage. The First Fabergé Egg: Alexander III commissioned the first Fabergé egg in 1883, marking the beginning of the intimate relationship between the Imperial Family and the House of Fabergé, a symbol of Russian craftsmanship and artistic revival. </p>
