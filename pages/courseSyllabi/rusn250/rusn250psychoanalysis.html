<h3>
Rusn 250. Why do we care that Bettelheim is a Freudian? 
</h3>

<p>
This week, we’ll be reading from Bruno Bettelheim’s book <i>The Uses of Enchantment</i> (1976). Bettelheim (1903-1990) was an Austrian psychologist who specialized in child psychology, but gained an international reputation for his work on Freud, psychoanalysis, and emotionally disturbed children. For our purposes, it’s most important that he’s a Freudian (meaning that he’s a student of Freud).

<p>
Bettelheim and Children
Bettelheim was a student of Freud and used many of Freud’s ideas and theories as jumping off points in investigating the psychological development of children. In The Uses of Enchantment, Bettelheim looks at fairy tales and attempts to identify how and why fairy tales play such a critical role in children’s psychological development. According to Bettelheim, the psychology of children differs from that of adults in some critical ways.
 </p>
<p>
Bettelheim says that young children have a strong belief in animism; until puberty, the sun, streams, stones, animals, etc. are not seen as being different from people. When the hero of a fairy tale is turned to stone, he may be immobilized and silenced, but he is not robbed of life. As kids, some of you may have read Sylvester and the Magic Pebble by William Steig. Sylvester is a donkey who finds a magic pebble; when frightened by a lion, Sylvester wishes to be safe and turns into a rock. However, he still retains his consciousness, even as a rock. As kids, we know that Sylvester is a donkey, but we also recognize that he is a person (has a family, has thoughts, feelings, etc.).
 </p>
<p>
Bettelheim also says that children have no understanding of death. Any conception of death may come from separation anxiety (the fear of being abandoned by one’s parents, whether intentionally or through their death) and mortal anxiety (the fear of one’s own death, often as a result of being abandoned by one’s parents). Children may recognize death as an isolated incident, but have no understanding of death as a natural part of life (i.e., they have a very hard time comprehending that everyone dies, and this is just part of life). Part of the reason for this is that children cannot grasp abstract concepts like death. They have a hard time with even basic abstract concepts such as permanence of quantity (things that change their shape are still the same: a quantity of water in a big cup looks different than the same quantity of water in a small cup [it looks different, but it’s still water]) or the concept of reversibility (subtraction reverses addition). Until the child is able to understand abstract concepts, the child cannot view the world other than subjectively (as being centered around her). While unable to grasp abstract concepts, the child maintains a personalized (self-centered) understanding of the world. She is preoccupied with herself and her own interests, particularly her own physical security, and sees everything in personal terms (she’s interested in herself, not humanity at large).
 </p>

For Bettelheim, another important aspect of the child’s psychology is the belief in magic. Children to not just believe in magic, but they need it—it plays an essential role in their development. Particularly when young, children are uncertain about their place in the world and are unsure that their parents will adequately protect them, and therefore need to believe that a superior power (fairy godmother, guardian angel, etc.) watches over them. The child believes he will be saved from any possible destruction because he is important, the center of the world.
 </p>

Kids get vicarious satisfaction from play, fantasy, fairy tales, etc. because they enable kids to confront the uncertain or the threatening in ways that enable children to retain control. For example, play enables kids to work through unconscious issues: playing with a doll or animal lets the child (of either sex) vicariously satisfy a desire for giving birth/caring for a baby. (However, according to Bettelheim, this is only good for boys if they don’t recognize this is what they’re doing.) Fairy tales are particularly good for kids because they provide a structure and vocabulary for working through difficult/uncomfortable fantasies or emotions. “Whatever the content of a fairy tale—w hich may run parallel to a child’s private fantasies whether these are oedipal, vengefully sadistic, or belittling of a parent—it can be openly talked about, because the child does not need to keep secret his feelings about what goes on in the fairy tale, or feel guilty about enjoying such thoughts” (57). Along with this, children do not necessarily understand everything in a fairy tale, and their understanding of tales may change over time; children understand in tales what they are ready and able to understand.
</p>

<p>
Given this positive function of fairy tales, Bettelheim tried to account for why evil exists in fairy tales and why they are sometimes scary. He concluded that evil appears in fairy tales because children know that it is part of the world, and fairy tales give children strategies for how to cope with it. Other children’s literature (mostly written either for education or entertainment) is sanitized and generally ignores evil and other genuinely scary things. Bettelheim argues that this actually does children a disservice: most kid’s books ignore the very real and pressing fears and anxieties that fairy tales actively address. By pretending that kids never feel stupid, don’t sometimes hate their parents/siblings, are not afraid of being abandoned, etc., these stories don’t help kids to resolve their feelings.
</p>

<p>
Bettelheim noticed that fairy tale characters (unlike real people…) are usually all good or all bad. He argued that children try to become good (by overcoming anxieties so that they can function) by associating with characters who overcome risk and are rewarded (i.e., the hero). Children don’t necessarily want to be good—< they want to be like the attractive hero, who is only coincidentally good. It is crucial that the hero is someone the child can relate to. (This is one of the ways in which fairy tales differ from myths, which are about gods. Kids know they are not gods and have a much harder time relating to myths.)

<p>
The reading from Bettelheim this week deals with both “Youngest Child” and “Two Sibling” tales. Please make sure you have a good grasp of the main characteristics of each type of tale before you read the assigned fairy tales from the Afanas'ev collection. As you read the fairy tales, compare them to Bettelheim’s model: does it fit these tales, or not? If not, how does the tale differ from Bettelheim’s model, and why do you think this might be?
