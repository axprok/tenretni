    Rusn 250. Why do we care that Bettelheim is a Freudian? 
    </h3>

    <p>


The next few weeks, we’ll be reading from Bruno Bettelheim’s book The Uses of Enchantment. Bettelheim (1903-1990) was an Austrian psychologist who specialized in child psychology, but gained an international reputation for his work on Freud, psychoanalysis, and emotionally disturbed children. For our purposes, it’s most important that he’s a Freudian (meaning that he’s a student of Freud).
 
</p>
<p>

But who was Freud, and why do we care that Bettelheim is a Freudian? Sigmund Freud (1856-1959) was an Austrian neurologist who founded the discipline of psychoanalysis, or “talk therapy.” Some of you may be familiar with Freud and his work on the significance and interpretation of dreams, but we’re not going to get that complicated. However, you do need to know some basic Freudian terms that Bettelheim will be using. 
*Note: Although some of Freud's ideas are now seen as outdated, it is important to look at his work in order to understand Bettelheim's approach to fairy tales. 

</p>
<p>

Key Freudian Terms
For Freud, the mind is composed of the conscious and the unconscious. The unconscious mind stores thoughts, memories, ideas, wishes, emotions, instincts, desires, needs, etc. of which the relatively shallow conscious mind is unaware because of their once traumatic or unacceptable nature. The unconscious may influence conscious thoughts and behavior and frequently manifests itself in symptoms and neuroses.

</p>
<p>
The conscious mind is divided into three parts, or three conflicting internal tendencies.
 </p>
<p>
The id is the part of the personality that is concerned with pleasure, immediate gratification, living for the moment with no thought for the future, etc., and is the most primitive motivational force. The id is also associated with infancy (the baby wants what it wants and it wants it now). The id is ruled by the “pleasure principle.” If gratification is not immediate, the subject forms a mental image of the gratification known as a “ wish fulfillment,” which satisfies the id’s immediate desire (though obviously without reducing the tension of the unfulfilled urge). The id isn’t necessarily bad and shouldn’t be suppressed, but it shouldn’t be allowed to dominate the personality. 
 </p>
<p>
The superego is the part of the personality that encourages responsibility, enforces the demands of the outside world and authorities, and generally serves as the inner policeman. The superego gives us pride in doing right and the fear of punishment for doing wrong (as well as guilt, self-reproach, etc.). The superego can be divided into the conscience (which tells us what is right and wrong) and the ego ideal (which aims our life toward the ideal, perfect goals instilled in us by society: marriage, stable career, family, etc.). Of course, nobody can live up to the impossible demands of the superego (and trying to do so isn’t much fun…), but it’s part of a balanced personality. 
 </p>
<p>
The ego is the part of the personality that interacts with the outside world, mediating between the id (primitive desires) and the superego (demands of outside environment). The ego is ruled by the “reality principle,” which delays gratification of urges and impulses until an appropriate time. The ego is the center of one’ s personality and consciousness, which establishes continuity and identify. The ego’s practical efforts to satisfy urges eventually help establish memories, skills, etc., and finally an identity. With the formation of the ego, the individual becomes a Self (a thinking “I”), rather than just a collection of needs and demands.
 </p>
<p>
This is all pretty abstract, so here’s a simple example. I love chocolate cake and I have one sitting in front of me. My id tells me to eat the whole cake because I love cake so much. My superego tells me that I shouldn’t have any cake because I’m on a diet and cake is bad for me, and besides, eating the whole cake is just gluttonous and wrong. My ego attempts to reach a compromise, telling me to eat one piece of cake (satisfying the id by eating cake, and satisfying the superego by not eating it all).
 </p>
<p>
The pleasure principle is the id-dominant desire to avoid work, trials, conflicts, etc. in favor of pleasure and immediate gratification (no thoughts of the future). The reality principle is the delayed gratification of a desire when reality doesn’t permit its immediate gratification. As you might guess, this is associated with the ego. To return to the cake example, eating the entire cake would be to succumb to the pleasure principle (I’m eating the whole cake now, regardless of the fact that it will make me sick). To eat only a piece of the cake would be to exercise the reality principle (I’m eating only a piece of the cake, because eating the whole thing will make me sick).
 </p>
<p>
Separation anxiety is the fear of leaving your parents (or of their death), and is most commonly experienced by young children and maladjusted adults. As part of normal development, the child must eventually realize that separation from parents is normal and is not something to be feared. Think about parents dropping their kids off at preschool; the first week, the kid clings to mom’s leg and screams and cries, but eventually is fine being left at school. The kid knows that mom will come back to get him at two o’clock, and everything will be fine.
 </p>
<p>
Repression is when the ego represses an inappropriate desire or urge. Repression must be strictly maintained to avoid anxiety. Repression may be long-term (for example, the repression of the primal scene [parents having sex] in childhood), but if the ego is poorly developed or the urge is too strong, the repression eventually spills out into daily life. This might take the form of the original urge, or might manifest in an unrelated form. For example, if what you really need or want is wanton sex, you might repress your sexual needs to such a degree that they eventually emerge as binge eating (oral satisfaction).
 </p>
<p>
Transference is the unconscious redirection of thoughts and feelings about one person, often from the past (e.g., a parent), onto another person in the present (e.g., one’s significant other, child, etc.), regardless of their actual degree of similarity or the appropriateness of such redirection. This may cause one to behave in inappropriate ways, treating the person onto whom characteristics are misdirected as actually possessing those characteristics. For example, a mother might overprotect her son because her own father was a criminal whom she wished to protect from danger and harm as a child but could not.
 </p>
<p>
Defense mechanisms aid in repression and maintain the sanity and stability of the individual, although they require great amounts of psychic energy to maintain. They include reaction formation, projection, displacement, and rationalization.
 </p>
<p>
Reaction formation replaces an impulse with an over-emphasized opposite. For example, a jealous sibling reacts to praise of the other by turning the hatred of the praise into excessive, demonstrative love. The overzealousness of the behavior often indicates that it stems from a repressed impulse. 
 </p>
<p>
Projection is mentally attributing the offending behavior or impulse to another. For example, a jealous husband accuses his wife of being unfaithful, when it is actually he who is (or wishes to be) unfaithful. Projection may involve reaction violently to the individual upon whom one has projected what is repressed (usually something negative) in one’s self. So, the husband might act as though this unfaithfulness is actually the property of his wife and not his own shortcoming (“I’m going to kill you if I see you flirting with those other men again!”).
 </p>
<p>
Rationalization is when a repressed impulse makes it to the conscious but is reinterpreted or misinterpreted as something else. In short, this is the formulation of natural-sounding reasons for unacceptable behavior. For example, a parent who beats their child does it “for the child’s own good;” this explanation for the otherwise unacceptable act removes any anxiety it may have caused.
 </p>
<p>
Displacement is when a repressed impulse sneaks out in a disguised form. For example, a student’s anger at a parent or professor is vented on the student’s roommate or significant other; the anger is let out in a manner acceptable to both the ego and the superego.
 </p>
<p>
Oedipal/Electra conflict involves the child’s unconscious desire to possess the opposite-sexed parent and eliminate the same-sexed one. This desire to possess the opposite-sexed parent is not necessarily a sexual impulse: a boy who wants to marry his mother doesn’t necessarily want to have sex with her or even know what sex is. The same-sexed parent is seen as an obstacle to true happiness achieved with the parent of the opposite sex. This desire is something that must be kept secret from the same-sexed parent for fear of retribution. For boys, the fear of the father’s retaliation is characterized by castration anxiety (removal of the genitals), which causes him to repress his desire for the mother. Because the boy cannot possess the mother, but the father can, the boy believes he can possess her vicariously by identifying with the father and emulating him as much as possible. This identification with the father successfully resolves the Oedipal conflict and indoctrinates the boy into his proper sexual role in life.  Successful resolution of the Oedipal/Electra conflict moves the individual into the latent stage, where the libido is dormant. Freud is much vaguer about the Electra conflict. The Electra conflict stems from the girl’s discovery that she (and all women) lack a penis. Therefore, her love for her father is both erotic and envious. She is upset that she does not have a penis (“penis envy”—a counterpart to the boy’s castration anxiety) and blames her mother for her perceived castration. Like the boy, the girl learns her sexual role by emulating the mother to possess the father vicariously, at which point she may pass into latency. However, Freud implies that girls never really get over their penis envy and always remain partially fixed at the phallic stage.

Freudian Stages of Development
According to Freud, the individual goes through five stages of normal development (the Freudian stages of development). A child has to move through the stages in order, and must resolve the particular erogenous zone fixation of his current stage of development before moving successfully on to the next. Frustration comes when needs are denied; overindulgence results when needs are met too fully and so the child never wishes to move on. If the child is overindulged or frustrated in any stage, fixation may occur and dominate the adult personality. Normal childhood development involves progress through each stage. Here’s a chart:
 </p>
<p>
Stage  Age  Features
Oral  0 to 1-1/2 Nursing
Anal  1-1/2 to 3 Expulsion/Retention
Phallic  3 to 5  Unconscious sexual desire; Oedipal stage
Latency 6 to 12  Dormant libido
Genital  Puberty Libido, libido, libido!
 </p>
 
<p>
The oral stage occurs from birth until the child is roughly a year and a half old; generally the stage is concerned with nursing. The oral cavity (the mouth) is the child’s primary focus. Frustration at this stage may result in pessimism, envy, suspicious, and sarcasm. Overindulgence may lead to an optimistic, gullible person who admires everyone.
 </p>
<p>
The anal stage occurs from roughly age one and a half to three and is focused on the anus and feces. The conflict at this stage is between the id (the pleasure in expelling waste) and the ego and superego (practical and societal pressures for bodily control). For example, kids want to poop at the moment their body registers that they need to go (the id tells them to pull down their pants and go wherever they are, even in the middle of the street). Their parents teach kids that they cannot constantly be controlled by their id, and that they cannot poop wherever they want, but must wait until they get to a bathroom. Sometimes during the anal stage (potty training), a child may put up a fight or refuse to go. Malicious excreting leads to an expulsive character (messy, disorganized, reckless, defiant, etc.). A retentive character is overindulged in this phase (the child holds in the excrement—this is where the expression “anal retentive” comes from…), resulting in a neat, precise, stingy, stubborn, passive-aggressive personality. This stage permanently affects the child’s attitude toward authority and possession of goods.
 </p>
<p>
The phallic stage occurs from roughly age three to five and is when crucial sexual conflict occurs. During this stage, the child is focused on the genitals (their own and those of others), and the stage is generally characterized by the Oedipal/Electra conflict. (See above for a definition.) Fixation may result in a reckless and narcissistic character, and if unresolved, the conflict may lead to an Oedipal/Electra Complex and the inability to form close relationships.
 </p>
<p>
The latent stage occurs from roughly age six to twelve (pre-pubescence) and is when the sexual drive is dormant. Sexual urges are repressed and focused into various activities (school, sports, friendships, etc.).
 </p>
<p>
The genital stage occurs with puberty, when the libido awakens and takes over. If all has gone well in the previous stages, adolescents will direct their sexual urges onto opposite sex peers (the goal of which is, obviously, pleasure of the genitals…). Note that for Freud, all normal relationships are exclusively heterosexual.

Bettelheim and Children
Bettelheim was a student of Freud and used many of Freud’s ideas and theories as jumping off points in investigating the psychological development of children. In The Uses of Enchantment, Bettelheim looks at fairy tales and attempts to identify how and why fairy tales play such a critical role in children’s psychological development. According to Bettelheim, the psychology of children differs from that of adults in some critical ways.
 </p>
<p>
Bettelheim says that young children have a strong belief in animism; until puberty, the sun, streams, stones, animals, etc. are not seen as being different from people. When the hero of a fairy tale is turned to stone, he may be immobilized and silenced, but he is not robbed of life. As kids, some of you may have read Sylvester and the Magic Pebble by William Steig. Sylvester is a donkey who finds a magic pebble; when frightened by a lion, Sylvester wishes to be safe and turns into a rock. However, he still retains his consciousness, even as a rock. As kids, we know that Sylvester is a donkey, but we also recognize that he is a person (has a family, has thoughts, feelings, etc.).
 </p>
<p>
Bettelheim also says that children have no understanding of death. Any conception of death may come from separation anxiety (the fear of being abandoned by one’s parents, whether intentionally or through their death) and mortal anxiety (the fear of one’s own death, often as a result of being abandoned by one’s parents). Children may recognize death as an isolated incident, but have no understanding of death as a natural part of life (i.e., they have a very hard time comprehending that everyone dies, and this is just part of life). Part of the reason for this is that children cannot grasp abstract concepts like death. They have a hard time with even basic abstract concepts such as permanence of quantity (things that change their shape are still the same: a quantity of water in a big cup looks different than the same quantity of water in a small cup [it looks different, but it’s still water]) or the concept of reversibility (subtraction reverses addition). Until the child is able to understand abstract concepts, the child cannot view the world other than subjectively (as being centered around her). While unable to grasp abstract concepts, the child maintains a personalized (self-centered) understanding of the world. She is preoccupied with herself and her own interests, particularly her own physical security, and sees everything in personal terms (she’s interested in herself, not humanity at large).
 </p>
<p>
For Bettelheim, another important aspect of the child’s psychology is the belief in magic. Children to not just believe in magic, but they need it—it plays an essential role in their development. Particularly when young, children are uncertain about their place in the world and are unsure that their parents will adequately protect them, and therefore need to believe that a superior power (fairy godmother, guardian angel, etc.) watches over them. The child believes he will be saved from any possible destruction because he is important, the center of the world.
 </p>
<p>
Kids get vicarious satisfaction from play, fantasy, fairy tales, etc. because they enable kids to confront the uncertain or the threatening in ways that enable children to retain control. For example, play enables kids to work through unconscious issues: playing with a doll or animal lets the child (of either sex) vicariously satisfy a desire for giving birth/caring for a baby. (However, according to Bettelheim, this is only good for boys if they don’t recognize this is what they’re doing.) Fairy tales are particularly good for kids because they provide a structure and vocabulary for working through difficult/uncomfortable fantasies or emotions. “Whatever the content of a fairy tale—w hich may run parallel to a child’s private fantasies whether these are oedipal, vengefully sadistic, or belittling of a parent—it can be openly talked about, because the child does not need to keep secret his feelings about what goes on in the fairy tale, or feel guilty about enjoying such thoughts” (57). Along with this, children do not necessarily understand everything in a fairy tale, and their understanding of tales may change over time; children understand in tales what they are ready and able to understand.
 </p>

<p>
Given this positive function of fairy tales, Bettelheim tried to account for why evil exists in fairy tales and why they are sometimes scary. He concluded that evil appears in fairy tales because children know that it is part of the world, and fairy tales give children strategies for how to cope with it. Other children’s literature (mostly written either for education or entertainment) is sanitized and generally ignores evil and other genuinely scary things. Bettelheim argues that this actually does children a disservice: most kid’s books ignore the very real and pressing fears and anxieties that fairy tales actively address. By pretending that kids never feel stupid, don’t sometimes hate their parents/siblings, are not afraid of being abandoned, etc., these stories don’t help kids to resolve their feelings.
 </p>

<p>
Bettelheim noticed that fairy tale characters (unlike real people…) are usually all good or all bad. He argued that children try to become good (by overcoming anxieties so that they can function) by associating with characters who overcome risk and are rewarded (i.e., the hero). Children don’t necessarily want to be good—< they want to be like the attractive hero, who is only coincidentally good. It is crucial that the hero is someone the child can relate to. (This is one of the ways in which fairy tales differ from myths, which are about gods. Kids know they are not gods and have a much harder time relating to myths.)

The reading from Bettelheim this week deals with both “Youngest Child” and “Two Sibling” tales. Please make sure you have a good grasp of the main characteristics of each type of tale before you read the assigned fairy tales from the Afanas'ev collection. As you read the fairy tales, compare them to Bettelheim’s model: does it fit these tales, or not? If not, how does the tale differ from Bettelheim’s model, and why do you think this might be?</p>
