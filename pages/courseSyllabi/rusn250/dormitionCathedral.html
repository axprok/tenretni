<figcaption>Fig.2 - Before the Moscow Olympics in 1979, the Soviets tried to show that they are a liberal and open-minded society.  They invited an openly gay pop singer Elton John to tour around the USSR.  Hence, we have this amazing image of Elton John in front of the Dormition Cathedral. Please note that while Elton John toured around the USSR, his concerts were kept secret from the general public in the USSR.  Only the most trusted members of the communist party were allowed to attend his concerts.  And there were only few in Moscow and Leningrad.  This was the Soviet-style propaganda operation to project an image of a liberal society for the West, not for the domestic audience.  At this point in Soviet history same sex male relations are still criminalized in the USSR.
