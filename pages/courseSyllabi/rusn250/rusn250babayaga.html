<p><b>Baba Yaga</b>
    <ul>
    <li>
    -Baba Yaga is a tough mother figure.
    </li>

    <li>
    -She (like Koshchey) represents the power of secrecy, or rather, perhaps, of strategic disclosure.
    </li>

    <li>
    -She is an ambiguous figure in fairy tales: she can help you or she can eat you. (She's cannibalistic!) She is sometimes like a fairy godmother, but sometimes like a wicked witch, and therefore she is neither.
    </li>

    <li>
    -like Koshchey, she is intimately connected to and has power over nature.
    </li>

    <li>
    -She has all sorts of objects associated with her: a house on chicken legs, her mortar, pestle, and broom,
    </li>

    <li>
    -She is lanky, long-nosed, and has a bony leg. She also has a great sense of smell and often “smells Russians”.
    </li>

    <li>
    -She often appears with siblings or daughters.
    </li>

    <li>
    -She is an asexual type of character and has both “masculine” and “feminine” traits.
    </li>

    <li>
    -She does not want to air out her dirty laundry (figuratively speaking...) 
    </li>
     
    </ul>
