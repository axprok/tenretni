<h3>Koliada</h3>

<ul>Koliada is a Slavic festival that takes place around Christmas and the Winter Solstice.
It is an ancient pre-Christian Slavic festival, marking the winter solstice. 
Ancient Slavs believed that during the dark and cold winter, the border between the spiritual and the mortal worlds is the thinnest. The purpose of Koliada was to bring new light to this dark period and prepare for the next year by blessing local households and keeping malevolent spirits away. For this reason, candles and bonfires were lit in preparation for Koliada to help the winter turn to spring and symbolize the return of the Sun. This gave the ancient Slavs hope and lifted their spirits during the depressing winter. The holiday includes a variety of traditions: 
<li>Caroling: Groups of singers visit homes to sing special songs, called koliadky, to celebrate the holiday</li>
<li>Games and fortune telling: These activities are also part of the Koliada celebration</li> 
<li>Bonfires: Bonfires are lit as part of the festivities</li> 
<li>Dressing up in unusual clothes: People may dress up in unusual clothes or imitate animals to represent the dead souls who return to receive gifts from the living</li>

</ul>

<p>
Koliada is also a Slavic nature spirit, a personification of the newborn winter Sun.
