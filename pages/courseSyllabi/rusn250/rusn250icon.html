<h3> What is Icon?</h3>

<p>
The icon is very stylized, and is not supposed to depict images, people, and events in a realistic way, but rather to portray theological doctrine.

<p>
Although this icon may seem to be composed of many unconnected elements, it actually tells a story, and can be read like any other text. Icons are generally read clockwise, starting from the top right, with the most important image in the middle. Here, the birth of Jesus in a cave and/or manger is in the center of the picture, indicating that this image is the most important. All the other images will relate to the central image in some way. Starting at the top right, we see an angel telling the shepherds of Christ’s birth. In the bottom right corner, Mary is sitting with the Christ child. Depictions of Jesus as a baby will always show him with a baby’s body and an adult’s head. On the bottom left, Joseph is talking to an old man, who represents doubt (that Mary was actually a virgin). We know that Joseph eventually conquers his doubt and believes because he has a halo. The top left corner shows angels appearing to the Wise Men (magi).
