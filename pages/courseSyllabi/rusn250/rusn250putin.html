<h3>Putin's Dictatorship</h3>

<p>
    The key difference between Putin's ideology and Soviet communism is its orientation in time.  Communism is a future-oriented ideology.  Putin's dictatorship glorifies the imperial past: both pre-revolutionary and the Soviet-era one.

<p>
Putin-era culture is revivalist.  Putin's favorite tsar is Alexander III who, after the assasination of his father, stopped political reforms initiated by his father and favored revivalism in arts and architecture.
