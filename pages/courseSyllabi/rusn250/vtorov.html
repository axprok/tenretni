<p>
Nikolai Vtorov was the wealthiest Russian industrialist if we do not count the fortune of the Romanov family.  His aggressive takeover policies earned him the nickname of "the Russian Morgan". He has been called "the first to break the age-old traditions in favour of a rational and intelligent organization of commercial business" (Pavel Buryshkin, cited in James L. West and Iurii A. Petrov (eds.), <i>Merchant Moscow</i> (Princeton UP, 1998, p. 123.)
Vtorov decided to stay in Russia after the 1917 Revolution and pledged loyalty to the Bolshevik regime. Less than a year later, in May 1918, he was assassinated.

Many of Vtorov's largest wartime projects, inherited by the Soviets, are still in operation: City of Elektrostal (former Zatishye) foundries and defence plants; City of Noginsk (former Bogorodsk) foundries and defence plants; AMO truck company) defunct since 2012. Legacy; MSTs6 AMOZIL company.

Vtorov's former residence, Spaso House, was seized by the Soviet government in 1918 and has since housed the United States Ambassador to the USSR and the Russian Federation.
