<p><b>Koshchei the Deathless</b>
<ul>
    <li>
    -In Russian, he is Koshchei Bessmertnyi (Literally “Koshchei without death”)
    </li>

    <li>
    -He is perpetually aged yet ageless. He is both immortal and mortal, old and young.
    </li>

    <li>
    -He is skinny and bony with scraggly hair, and therefore suspicious.
    </li>

    <li>
    -He is intimately connected with nature: his death is hidden away and protected by representatives of many realms of the natural world; he seems to have some power over natural forces.
    </li>

    <li>
    -Traditionally, the folk tale motif usually associated with him is that the tale’s hero must find Koshchei’s death in order to defeat him.
    </li>

    <li>
    -He can be a father figure.
    </li>

    <li>
    -He can be outsmarted.
    </li>

    <li>
    -He is a representative of the importance of secrecy. 
    </li>
