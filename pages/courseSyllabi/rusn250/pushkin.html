<ul>
    <li>Alexander Pushkin (1799â€“1837) holds an unparalleled place in Russian culture as the founder of modern Russian literature and a cornerstone of national identity. His influence extends far beyond his literary achievements, deeply shaping Russian language, thought, and artistic tradition.</li>
    <li>Pushkin celebrated Russian folklore, history, and traditions. His narratives and characters often embody the spirit of the Russian people, contributing to a sense of national identity.</li>
    <li>Genre innovation 1: His literary fairy tales in verse, such as "Tale of Tsar Saltan" (written in trochaic tetrameter 1831), elevated Russian poetry to a new level of artistic excellence.  </li>
    <li>Pushkin innovated Russian verse and established iambic tetrameter as the classical Russian poetic meter.</li>
    <li>Genre innovation 2: fantastic tales set in St. Petersburg, such as "The Queen of Spades" (1833) showcase Pushkin's innovation in short fiction.  This tale inspired Fedor Dostoevsky to wrtie his famous novel <i>Crime and Punishment</i> (1866).</li>

    <li>Alexander Pushkin, the father of modern Russian literature, was of African origin.  Today most scholars agree that that his great-grandfather was actually from Cameroon. Alexander Pushkin himself was very proud of his African ancestry.
