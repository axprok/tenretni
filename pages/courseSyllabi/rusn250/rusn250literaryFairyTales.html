<h3>Literary Fairy Tales</h3>

<p>
Alexander Pushkin.  <a href="saltan.html">Tale of Tsar Saltan"</a> (1831)
<br>
based on the plot of a folk take "Wicked Sisters".  Written in trochaic tetrameter, a meter imitating the meter of the folk song.  A common folktale in Belarus, Russia, and Ulraine.  You can read more about Pushkin's uses of folklore in Michael Wachtel's article <a href="files/wachtelPushkinsTurnFolklore.pdf">"Pushkin's Turn to Folklore."</a>
</p>

<ul>Art Works inspired by the "Tale of Tsar Saltan"
<li>Ivan Bilibin's <a href="bilibin.html">illustrations</a> (1905)</li>
<li>Nikolai Rimskii-Korsakov opera "Tale of Tsar Saltan" (1900).  We listened to a small interlude from the opera "The Flight of a Bumble-Bee."  The piece closes Act III, Tableau 1, during which the magic Swan-Bird changes Prince Gvidon Saltanovich (the Tsar's son) into an insect so that he can fly away to visit his father</li>
<li></li>
</ul>


<p>
Tatyana Tolstaya.  "Date with a Bird" (1983)
<br>
Tolstaya uses folkloric image of a bird of paradise <a href="birdsOfParadise.html">Sirin</a>.  Excellent use of metaphor.
