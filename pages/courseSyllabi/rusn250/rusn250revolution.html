<p>
Communists initially didn't want to use folklore for their propaganda purposes.  They considered folklore an old art, which will be replaced by the new art.  
<br>But in the 1930s Stalin and his cultural producers started using folk-style stories, such as epics, folktales, lubok, puppet theater, to promote communist ideas.  See Marfa Kriukova's novinas ("Tale of the Pole" 1937), propaganda immitations of folktales, "The War of Kings", a comic strip style story explaining to illiterate peasants the origins and meaning of the WWI.
<br>
Stalin's novinas, immitations of folk tales are forms of communist fakelore.
