<h3>Kika</h3>

<div class="moi">
This is a married woman's headdress called kika.
It is covered in the back so that the married woman's hair would not be visible,
and it was worn by Russian married women after they got married.

The kika hat is one of the most ancient headpieces, related to pagan cults and rituals.

<div class="moi">
Some kika hats looked like a cow head with horns that were a symbol of fertility and abundance. That is why the kika hat was worn only by the married women. In some regions, there was a tradition to give a kika with small horns to a just married woman, then to change to another one with bigger horns after the first child delivery. The most respected woman wore the biggest horns. The front part of the kika hat was artfully embroidered with beads, pearls and goldwork. Women believed that skillful, rich d√©cor and pearly pendants may hide the real age and distract from the wrinkled face.
<br>
Horns have been considered a powerful talisman since ancient times. They brought good luck, protected from the evil eye and helped in battle.
