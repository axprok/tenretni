<p>
Aleksey Remizov (1877-1957). Remizov is a modernist writer and artist who used hagiography to develop his own unique writer's style.  He completed "About Pyotr and Fevronia of Murom" in 1951. It is based on the <a href="rusn250peterFevronia.html">hagiographic tale "Peter and Fevronia"</a> from the 1500s.  Remizov was born in Moscow but after the communist revolution in October 1917, he moved to Paris.
