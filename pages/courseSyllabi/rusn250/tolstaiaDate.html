    <h3>Tatyana Tolstaya's story "Date with a Bird" (1983)</h3>

    <ul>
        
        <li>In ''Date With a Bird,'' a boy (Petya) during a country vacation develops a crush on a glamorous neighbor Tamila. In her house, ''everything was allowed: eat bread and jam with unwashed hands, slouch, bite your nails. . . . No one shouted, lectured, called for order, cleanliness, and common sense. . . . At home he had to be quiet about Tamila (when I grow up and marry her, then you'll find out).''</li>
        <li>Tolstaya uses folkloric image of a bird of paradise <a href="birdsOfParadise.html">Sirin</a>.  Sirin brings changes to two characters in the story: brings death to Petya's grandfather and makes Petya aware of two key drives of adult life (Thanatos and Eros).  In Sigmund Freud's theory, Thanatos, or the death instinct, is the counterpart to Eros, or the life instinct, and both are fundamental drives that influence human activity and behavior.  Petya's encounter with Sirin is a metaphor of an inevitable encountary with adulthood and expulsion from the fairy tale world of childhood. </li>
    </ul>
