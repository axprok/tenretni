    <h3>Revivalism in Russian painting</h3>
<p>
Among artists interested in Russia's past before Peter the Great's Westernization Viktor Vasnetsov and Mikhail Nesterov are the most important.  Viktor Vasnetsov used the themes from Russian folklore for his works.  Mikhail Nesterov was interested in religious mysticism and tried to convey those themes in his images.

<p>
The world captured in Nesterovâ€™s paintings and the world portrayed here in this painting are the worlds of gone by days, places of stilness, tradition and repose while in reality the years in which some of these paintings, this one in 1922 for example, were particularly turbulent in Russia. These paintings were, perhaps, for Nesterov as well as for us a means of escaping the reality with its changes and the fast-paced life, and retreating into a world which is a mix of old times and religious meditation.
