<h3>St. Petersburg</h3>

<p>Peter the Great founded the city as the new capital of the newly established Russian Empire in 1703.  It is a major seaport for the landloched empire

The new St. Petersburg is the center of Westernization for a non-Western country.  Peter establishes western-style schools, a shipyard, a new Western-style army and navy.

In 1764, Catherine the Great sets up the first school for women: Smolny Institure.  The decree says that the institute should "give the state educated women, good mothers, useful members of the family and society."

St. Petersburg is the birthplace of Russian literature and the setting of many short stories and novels.  Many fantastic tales, as Tzvetan Todorov defines it, are set in St. Petersburg. For example, Pushkin's "Queen of Spades" (1833), Gogol's "Night before Christmas" (1832) and "The Nose" (1836).
