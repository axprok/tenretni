•   Baba Yaga and Koshchei the Deathless – characteristics and theories about them

Baba Yaga 
-Baba Yaga is a mother figure.
-She (like Koshchey) represents the power of secrecy, or rather, perhaps, of strategic disclosure.
-She is an ambiguous figure in fairy tales: she can help you or she can eat you. (She's cannibalistic!) She is sometimes like a fairy godmother, but sometimes like a wicked witch, and therefore she is neither.
-She (like Koshchey) is intimately connected to and has power over nature.
-She has all sorts of objects associated with her: a house on chicken legs, her mortar, pestle, and broom,
-She is lanky, long-nosed, and has a bony leg. She also has a great sense of smell and often “smells Russians”.
-She often appears with siblings or daughters.
-She is an asexual type of character and has both “masculine” and “feminine” traits.
-She does not want to air out her dirty laundry (figuratively speaking...)

Koshchei the Deathless 
Some facts about Koshchei (sometimes spelled Koshchey) the deathless, a character you will meet in this week's stories:
-In Russian, he is Koshchei Bessmertnyi (Literally “Koshchei without death”)
-He is perpetually aged yet ageless. He is both immortal and mortal, old and young.
-He is skinny and bony with scraggly hair, and therefore suspicious.
-He is intimately connected with nature: his death is hidden away and protected by representatives of many realms of the natural world; he seems to have some power over natural forces.
-Traditionally, the fairy tale motif usually associated with him is that the tale’s hero must find Koshchei’s death in order to defeat him.
-He can be a father figure.
-He can be outsmarted.
-He is a representative of the importance of secrecy.
