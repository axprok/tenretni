    </li>

    <li>
    Baba Yaga
    <ul>
    <li>
    -Baba Yaga is a tough mother figure.
    </li>

    <li>
    -She (like Koshchey) represents the power of secrecy, or rather, perhaps, of strategic disclosure.
    </li>

    <li>
    -She is an ambiguous figure in fairy tales: she can help you or she can eat you. (She's cannibalistic!) She is sometimes like a fairy godmother, but sometimes like a wicked witch, and therefore she is neither.
    </li>

    <li>
    -She (like Koshchey) is intimately connected to and has power over nature.
    </li>

    <li>
    -She has all sorts of objects associated with her: a house on chicken legs, her mortar, pestle, and broom,
    </li>

    <li>
    -She is lanky, long-nosed, and has a bony leg. She also has a great sense of smell and often “smells Russians”.

    <li>
    -She often appears with siblings or daughters.
    </li>

    -In Russian, he is Koshchei Bessmertnyi (Literally “Koshchei without death”)
    </li>

    <li>
    -He is perpetually aged yet ageless. He is both immortal and mortal, old and young.
    </li>

    <li>
    -He is skinny and bony with scraggly hair, and therefore suspicious.
    </li>

    <li>
    -He is intimately connected with nature: his death is hidden away and protected by representatives of many realms of the natural world; he seems to have some power over natural forces.
    </li>

    <li>
    -Traditionally, the folk tale motif usually associated with him is that the tale’s hero must find Koshchei’s death in order to defeat him.
    </li>

    <li>
    -He can be a father figure.
    </li>
