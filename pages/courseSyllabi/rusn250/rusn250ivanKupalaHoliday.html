<h3>Ivan Kupala Folk Festival</h3>

<p>
It is a pagan folk festival.  It is celebrated by the Eastern Slavs on the shortest night of the year.  In folk tradition it was the day recognizing the summer solstice. As we talked before this is a pagan holiday that coincides roughly with the Christian holiday of Natiivity of St. John the Baptist. 
</p>

<p> 
Kupala Night is filled with rituals related to water, fire and herbs. Most Kupala rituals take place at night.  People gather herbs and flowers and decorating people and houses with them, bathe, sending garlands on water, light fires, and jump over fire.

<p>
The Slavs believed that only once a year, on St. John's Day, a fern blooms. This mythical flower, which does not exist in nature, is supposed to give those who pick it and keep it with them miraculous powers. According to beliefs, the bearer of the flower becomes clairvoyant, can understand the language of animals, see all treasures, no matter how deep they are in the ground, and enter treasuries unhindered by holding the flower to locks and bolts (they must crumble before it), wield unclean spirits, wield earth and water, become invisible and take any form.

<p>
The holiday inspired composers, artists, filmmakers to create musical pieces, paintings, films.
