Bears, like other animals, may symbolize nations. The Eurasian brown bear has been used to personify Russia since the early 19th century.  During the Soviet era, a bear was selected to be the mascot for the 1980 Summer Olympic Games. The games were held in Moscow and marked the first time that Russia or the Soviet Union had hosted the world’s most notable sporting event. While “Misha” was not specifically a symbol chosen to represent “Russia”, it is very likely that a bear was selected because of its association with Russia in other countries. Also known as “Mishka” or “The Olympic Misha”, the mascot was designed by Victor Chizhikov, a Russian illustrator known for his work on children’s books. Misha had all the characteristics which the Soviet hosts wanted to portray to the world—he was large, furry, smiling, affable, and lovable. He clearly portrayed the friendly image that the Soviets wished the world to see when they visited Moscow for the games.
