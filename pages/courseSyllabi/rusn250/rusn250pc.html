<h3>The Primary Chronicle</h3>



<p>
The Primary Chronicle was compiled in Kyiv in 1037-1040.  
<br>
Nestor is one of most famous scribes of the Primary Chronicle
The Primary Chronicle follows the conventions of hagiography.
<br>
See for example lives of SS Boris and Gleb, the sons of St. Vladimir.
They know that they will get killed but follow self-sacrificsing model life of JS.
<br>
Serge Zenkovsvky notes that Eastern Orthodox saints follow kenotic model of sainthood.  
<br>
Greek word kenosis means 'self-emptying' of one's own will and becoming entirely receptive to God and the divine will.
