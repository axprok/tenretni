<p><b>Methodology</b><br>
The present course, a continuation of the discussions begun in the separate one-credit course in the spring 2025 semester, is designed to help you experience Lithuania as it has interacted in its often difficult history with its at times hostile neighbor, Russia. These complex interactions between the histories of Lithuania and Russia will be guided by the following question: “Who Wants Whom to Remember What, Why, When, and Where?” It is thus animated by a notion of the constructed and contested nature of history and the past.
