		Rusn 101 Syllabus.  Elementary Russian.
		</h3>

<p>
Elementary Russian I is an introductory course in Russian language and culture based on the
video/textbook series <i>Live from Russia!</i> which introduces us to an American photographer on his first
trip to Moscow and his new Russian friends. In the first semester, students should reach the ACTFL1
Novice-Mid speaking proficiency level by mastering the Cyrillic alphabet, learning some basics of
Russian grammar, and building a foundation of necessary vocabulary and conversational expressions.
At the Novice-Mid proficiency level students are able to understand and respond to direct
questions and communicate on simple, everyday topics.
</p>

<p>

Completion of the full year of Elementary Russian at William & Mary brings many of our students into the Intermediate-Low speaking proficiency level making it possible to succeed in the William & Mary 6-week summer program in Vilnius, Lithuania. 
</p>

<p>
According to ACTFL it takes about 480 hours of full-time intensive language training <a href="https://www.languagetesting.com/how-long-does-it-take">to reach</a> the Novice-High/Intermediate-Low speaking proficiency level in Russian (https://www.languagetesting.com/how-long-does-it-take"). With this in mind please remember that we only meet for around 65 class hours in a regular semester, or 130 hours in two semesters. 
<br>
This leaves about 250 hours for you to practice over the next year to reach that level. There is a lot you can do to help yourself reach the speaking proficiency goal. Mainly, you need to commit to daily deliberate practice with the Russian language: active engagement with the material during each class session, constructive HW and study time, taking every opportunity outside of class to learn
about Russian culture and practice speaking the language.
<br>
The class meets five times per week. Daily class participation and written practice are instrumental for your success in this course and for reaching the proficiency goals mentioned above. If you miss a class because of illness, you are responsible for contacting the instructor and making arrangements for completing missed work in a timely fashion. You will find a Calendar with a general course overview on the Blackboard course site under the Course Information menu item. The dates listed for end-of-module assessments are tentative and you should always rely on the specific moduleâ€™s schedule for the dates when all assignments and assessments are due. However, our plan is to cover each chapter module in 2 weeks.
