		Rusn 395 Syllabus.  The Enemy Among Us.
		</h3>

<p>
<b>What is this course about?</b>
An introduction to spy fiction in Russia and Western Europe, this course examines major Russian, British, and American contributions to the spy genre in literature, film, and television. It examines the historical predecessors of the spy novel (the historical novel, the rogue tale and the folktale) and traces the development of the spy story from its early classical manifestations in works by Eric Ambler and Alfred Hitchcock, to the present day, represented by bestselling authors, such as Boris Akunin and John Le Carr√©. Course materials include short stories, novels, films, critical articles. 
</p>

<p>
Our discussions will focus on the basic elements of the spy genres (the spy novel, the techno thriller, etc.), including structure, setting, the spy, the criminal/villain, and the resolution. We will trace the development of the spy from how the earlier practitioners of the genre envisioned the special agent to the complex figure today. Judging by the popularity of espionage thrillers, tv spy dramas, and the daily mention of espionage in the news media, readers and viewers continue to be fascinated by stories of mystery, deception, and moral ambiguity. Through our investigation, we will try to understand the reasons behind the global popularity of these enticing genres.
