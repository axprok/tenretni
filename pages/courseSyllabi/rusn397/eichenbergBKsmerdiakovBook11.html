    <figcaption>Fig. 1. The third meeting of Ivan and Smerdyakov
        <br>Smerdyakov confesses the murder
        <br>blames Ivan for the moral justification
        <br>shows the ultimate evidence--stolen 3000 rubles
        <br>"He (Ivan) looked at Smerdyakov with insane horror.
        <br>The latter, not in the least disturbed with his fear, 
        <br>kept fishing around in his stocking
        <br><b>as if</b> he were trying to get hold of something and pull it out ...
        <br>It's all there sir, all three thousand" (624)
