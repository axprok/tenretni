            <li>Chapter 1. The Fatal Day
                <br>show instead of a trial (656)
                <br>women for Mitya, men against him (657)
                <br>famous lawyer Fetyukovich, legal aspect of the case, not the moral one (658)
                <br>from Petersburg: Defender Fetyukovich and Prosecutor Ippolit Kirillovich
                <br>the Courtroom: center judges, right stern lower class jury, left Mitya and his defender (660) 
                <br>Kahoot question. Id about whom Mitya says: "The Dog died like a dog!" (661)

            <li>Chapter 2. Dangerous Witnesses
                <br>Witnesses for the prosecution
                <br>Grigory: the door was open, he was drunk and say nothing (665)
                <br>Rakitin: environment made Mitay kill, (667)
                <br>Snegirev shows up drunk (669)
                <br>Trifon turns out to be a thief himself (669)
                <br>Pan Mussyalovich is a cheat (670).
                <br>the accusation, neverthereless seems to be irrefutable (670).

            <li>Chapter 3. Medical Expertise and One Pound of Nuts
                <br>medical science experts: two claim Mitya is insane, Varvinsky disagrees
                <br>Dr. Herzenstube tells the story of one pound of nuts and the neglected child
                <br>presents Mitya as a kind and grateful person,
                <br>a believer in God.
                <br>again psychology speculations are presented as sheer manipulation by Katerina Ivanovna who bring an expensive expert from Moscow.

            <li>Chapter 4. Fortune Smiles on Mitya
                <br>Alesha testifies about amulet and 1500 in it
                <br>KI testifies that Mitia gave her money to save the father.  Mitia says that KI's testimony ruined him (681)
                <br>Grusha testifies that Smerdyakov killed, the Mitia is not guilty, and Rakitin is her cousin and is ashamed of this fact because Grusha is a woman of questionable reputation (683).

            </li>

            <li>Chapter 5. A Sudden Catastrophe
                <br>Ivan testifies as a dying man (684)
                <br>Ivan brings the money (from Smerdyakov), confesses that he is guilty of the murder (686)
                <br>KI submits Mitya's letter to exhonerate Ivan/ or this is love as revenge (see below) (687)
                <br>Katya's confession why she gave 3000 to Mitya "to catch him out" (688)
                <br>KI's love is like revenge (691)
                <br>Prosecutor is encouraged by the new evidence (692).

                <b>Prosecutor's speech: chapters 6-9</b>
                Chapter 6. The Prosecutor's Speech. Characterizations.
                <br>Prosecution 
                <br>Ippolit.
                <br>Narrator says that it was his swan song: he dies 9 months after it
                <br>Dostoevsky is sarcastic.  Instead of something being born after 9 months, death follows the misleading positivist accusation of the innocent.
                <br>Positivist: believes only in material evidence and facts.
                <br>His facts require interpretation.  He misinterprets all of them: "As to the legend of this amulet--it is hard even to imagine anything more contrary to reality" (701).


            </li>

            <li>Chapter 7. Prosecutor's speech: A Historical Survey
                <br>Prosecution claims the premeditated murder based on the letter provided by Katerina Ivanovna (703).

            </li>

            <li>Chapter 8. Prosecutor's Speech: A Treatise on Smerdyakov
                <a href=""></a>
                <br>Pr. claims that Sm. begged Ivan to stay. We know how wrong the conclusions of the prosecution (708).
                <br>The prosecutor invokes the sixth person who could have killed (709), that is the devil :)
                <br>Prosecutor makes the wrong interpretation: Mitya jumped down to make sure that the only witness to his evil deed was no longer alive (714).
            </li>

            <li>Chapter 9. the 4th chapter of the Prosecutor's speech
                <br>Psychology at Full Steam.
                <br>The Galloping Troyka.
                <br>The Finale of the Prosecutor's Speech
                <br>Mitya refers to Ippolit and his logical argument that flattens human complexity as "Bernards!" invoking the positivist scientist Claude Bernard (723).
                <br>

            </li>

            <li>Chapter 10. The Defense Attorney's Speech
                <a href=""></a>
                <br>spoke less correctly (725), appeals to hearts rather than just reason.
                <br>psychology is a stick with two ends (727)
                <br>One can draw whatever conclusions one likes from it (728)
                <br>
            </li>

            <li>Chapter 10.  There was no money
                <a href=""></a>
                <br>Fetiukovich argues convincingly
                <br>that the robbery, the way  the prosecution describes it, never happened.
                <br>We know about the existence of money under the matress only from Smerdyakov (who is dead now).  
                <br>The money was hidden under the mattress but the bed from where supposedly the money was stolen was not rumpled at all (729).  
                <br>No witnesses, no evidence that the robbery happened the way Smerdyakov narrated it.

            </li>

            <li>Chapter 12. And there was no murder either.
