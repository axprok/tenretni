        <h4>Book 9 Notes</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>chapter 1. The Start of Perkhotin's Career
                <br>Madame Khokhlakova's notes that she didn't give money to Mitya (450)

                <br>Neliudov arrives "as if on purpose" (452)  This is how God acts in miraculous coincidences in Dostoevsky. the major device for film melodrama in 20th century.
                <br>Neliudov evidence vs. the bottom of his heart: he knows Mitya didn't kill (455)
                <br>split
                <br><br>The prosecutor Ippolit Kirillovich no last name (no family name for him, he is a deracinated modern man, he hurts Mitya, or perhaps it is Dostoevsky's proverbial sloppiness) (452)
                <br>Ipollit is vain, high opinion about himself
                <br>psychologist, knows human soul thru science (bs, according to Dostoevsky) (452)
                <br><br>Dr. Varvinsky: a science man, blind and stupid, instead of getting suspicious about the unusually long seizure of Smerdyakov, he says that "this case belongs to science" (456).
                <br><br>witnesses: Perkhotin, Grigory (Dmitry killed (454)).

            </li>

            <li>Chapter 3.  The First Torment
                <br>Mitya drinks water and asks to punish him (458).  He denies killing his father.  Nobody believes him. Cf. how Zosima's mysterious visitor Michael is treated when he confesses, tells the truth.  Society does not believe him.
                <br>Grushenka too is confessing of her guilt (457).  Feeling guilty is good.
