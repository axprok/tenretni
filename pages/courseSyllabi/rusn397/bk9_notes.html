                <br>D.A. Nikolai Neliudov local women's naughty boy (452-453)
                <br>Neliudov arrives "as if on purpose" (452)  This is how God acts in miraculous coincidences in Dostoevsky. the major device for film melodrama in 20th century.
                <br>Neliudov evidence vs. the bottom of his heart: he knows Mitya didn't kill (455)
                <br>split
                <br><br>The prosecutor Ippolit Kirillovich no last name (no family name for him, he is a deracinated modern man, he hurts Mitya, or perhaps it is Dostoevsky's proverbial sloppiness) (452)
                <br>Ipollit is vain, high opinion about himself
                <br>psychologist, knows human soul thru science (bs, according to Dostoevsky) (452)
                <br><br>Dr. Varvinsky: a science man, blind and stupid, instead of getting suspicious about the unusually long seizure of Smerdyakov, he says that "this case belongs to science" (456).
                <br><br>witnesses: Perkhotin, Grigory (Dmitry killed (454)).

            </li>

                <br>SUFFERING: separation from Grusha, hunting Mitia with their preset assumptions
                <br>Mitya drinks water and asks to punish him (458).  He denies killing his father.  Nobody believes him. Cf. how Zosima's mysterious visitor Michael is treated when he confesses, tells the truth.  Society does not believe him.
                <br>Grushenka too is confessing of her guilt (457).  Feeling guilty is good.
                <br>Mitya: "Oh, gentlemen, I'm resurrected" (460).
                <br>Mitya drinks water (458)
                <br>Grushenka weeps (463).

            <li>Chapter 8. 
                <br>title of the chapter: The Evidence of the Witnesses.  The Wee One (Дитё in Russian).
                <br>the meaning of the title: two different dimensions: money vs. soul salvation
                <br>the main question is 3000 rubles
                <br>vs. the main concern for Mitya--love ("a tenderness such as never known before" (508) + Grushenka)
                <br>witness 1: Trifon 2 parties 6K total (501)
                <br>interrogators rejoice at 6K testimony (501)
                <br>witness 2: Kalganov 6K
                <br>witness 3: Pan Mussylovich: Mitya offered to buy him out for 3K (502)
                <br>witness 4: Maximov Mitya had 20000 rubles (504)
                <br>witness 5: Grushenka first party was for 3000 rubles, never heard about 1500 rubles (505).
                <br>Mitya's dream: "I had a good dream gentlemen" : "a tenderness such as he has never known before" (508).
                The word for tenderness is "umilenie" in Russian the same as for the genre of the icon "Tender Mercy."
