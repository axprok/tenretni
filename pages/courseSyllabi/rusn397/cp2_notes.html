            <br>1.  Transitional Space: Room/intersection/bridge/, open doors
            <br>2.  Central Ideas are tested, very often presented in an inverted way.
    <br>•   For example, a villain would enact protagonist’s thought in front of him (Part 5, chapter 3): 
    <br>•   Self interest and Doing Good for the Community, 
    <br>•   Sonia and Rask are sinners and there is no difference between them.
