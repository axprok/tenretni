<h4>III.    Reading and Viewing Assignments</h4>

<p>
All reading and film viewing assignments must be completed prior to the date indicated in the section “Schedule of Assignments.”  Students are responsible not only for the physical act of reading the words contained in the assigned texts, but they are expected to think about what they’ve read and be able to discuss the ideas and events these words represent.
