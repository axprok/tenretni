<h4>Sistine Madonna in Crime & Punishment</h4>

<p>
The Sistine Madonna is one of the most sacred images of purity and divine grace. For a corrupt, cynical man like Svidrigailov — who is associated with moral decay, lust, and death — to discuss this painting creates a striking moral and spiritual contrast. It’s Dostoevsky’s way of showing that even the most depraved soul can recognize beauty and holiness, yet remain untouched by it.
