        <h4>The Brothers Karamazov.  Part 2 notes</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Ch 1.  They Arrive at the Monastery
                <br>Miusov goes out of boredom.
                <br>Pyotr Kalganov
                <br>Miusov fights with bufoon Fedor (37-38)
                <br>note: Zosima's hermitage is away from the monastery. The monsatery is corrupt.
            </li>

            <li>Ch 2.  The Old Buffoon
                <br>bufoon in presence of Zosima
                <br>Bufoon is a foil of holy fool
                <br>one former is spiritually empty, the latter is wise and Christ-like.
                <br>
                <br>Rakitin appears (43)
                <br>Fedor: "buffoon out of shame" (43)

            </li>Ch 3. Zosima does his emotional work
            <br>women of faith are the opposite of reason-driven men and godless bufoons like Fedor
            <br>You have wept, and you will weep again, but joy will come to you even in your tears (50)
            <br>This line expresses Dostoevsky’s deepest Christian conviction — that salvation comes through suffering and compassion, 
            <br>not through fucking logic or reason.
            <br>
            
            <li>Ch 4 A Lady of Little Faith
                <br>the chapter foreshadows Alesha's trajectory
                <br>Zosima to Madame Khokhlakova: Faith comes from love in action (not let me be sure that I have a proof for my faith and then I will love)
                <!-- <br>later: Crisis  Alyosha after Zosima’s death. Loss of faith through disappointment.
                <br>Rebirth: Alyosha’s  vision (Book VII)    
                <br>Faith returns through love and beauty.
                <br>Embodiment: Alyosha with the boys  Faith lives in humble action and compassion.-->

            </li>

            <li>Chapter 5 Theory vs. Reality
            <br>the guests at Zosima’s 
                debate whether the Church should serve the State or the State should be transformed by the Church.
            <br>Ivan Karamazov explains the “Church ideal,” where moral love would replace punishment and law.
        <br>the author interrupts this anstract conversation 
        <br>with Dmitry’s violent entrance to contrast abstract ideals 
        <br>with the rawreality of human nature — 
        <br>showing that true faith must be lived, not  discussed.      
            </li>

            <li>Ch 6 "Why is Such a Man Alive!"
                <br>scandal scene between Mitia and Fedor
                <br>money, fiancee of Mitia
                <br>seductress they fight for her
                <br>miracle: Zosima bows to Mitia (74)
                <br>Everyone is wondering what this means
