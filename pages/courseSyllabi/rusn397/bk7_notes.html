        <ul>Chapter 1. The Odor of Corruption
            <br>Ferapont leads rebellion against Zosima
            <br>Rakitin is present (328)

            <br>Alesha "future hero" (329)
            <br>Zosima a holy fool (331)
            <br>Zosima attracts people by love not by miracles (331)
            <br>Scandal scene (334-337)
            <br>Ferapont leads the rebellion agaisnt Zosima: no miracle, hence no holiness (333-334)
            <br>Ferapont "was supposedly a holy fool" (334), not the real one

        </ul>

            <br>Rakitin calls Ivan Vanechka, he feels equal or even superior to Ivan whose moral fall (departure to Moscow) he enjoys.

        <ul>Chapter 3. An Onion
            <br>Grushenka is 22 at the time when the action of the novel is taking place (343).
            <br>lives next to the Cathedral Square (343)--must be a good person, at least in the future :)
            <br>from clergy (344)
            <br>had gotten into ... "gescheft" (344)
            <br>Grushenka "leaped ... onto his knees" (348)
            <br>Alesha about Grushenka: "I came here looking for a wicked soul ... but I found a true sister ... a loving soul" (351).
            <br>
            <br>The Onion Parable (352-353)
            <br>This is a folk story (cf. Zosima’s room, p. 32)
            <br>Guardian angel argues with God
            <br>Onion—weeping/redemption.  
            <br>She claims the onion as her personal vehicle of salvation—absence of love for others==hell.  
            <br>a wicked woman: "it's my onion, not yours"(352).
            <br>Onion breaks.
            <br>meaning of the parable: 
            <br>The story demonstrates the vastness of God's mercy 
            <br>in providing a chance for even the wicked to be saved. 
            <br>However, it ultimately places the 
            <br><b>responsibility for salvation in the hands of the individual</b>, 
            <br>whose own pride can undo the greatest opportunities for grace
            <br>the narrator is Grushenka
                        
            <br>Grushenka: "I'll take the knife with me today" (354).
            <br>Grushenka repents that she tries to seduce Alesha
            <br>Grushenka ab. Alesha: "he is the first to pity me" (357).
            <br>Alesha does not judge her
            <br>Rakitin gets mad because he cannot destroy Alesha (358).  He does not fulfill his narrative function: to bring corruption to the innocent.
        </li>

        <li>Cana of Galilee
            <br>miracle 1: she (Grushenka) didn't take a knife (360)
            <br>miracle 2: In the monastery miracle that nobody but Alesha notices.
            <br>miracle 3 in the John's gospel story: water to wine
            
            <br>narrative stance: “The Feast of Cana” episode is a dramatic form of narration, the movement between objective and subjective (we see this first as objective and then it becomes Alesha’s vision)
