    <ul>
        <li>ch 1 Satire of socialists and atheists
            <br>Lebeziatnikov's ideas: 
            <br>denies family and God, 
            <br>plans to replace them with socialist commune
            <br>communes is the new environment that will remove any causes for crime
            <br>sex workers are women who protest social injustice
            <br>He respects Sonia for her social protest against social injustice (369)
            <br>women will be equal to men in new communities
            <br>adultery as a form of poliamory is the new form of social collectivity (365)

            <br>art should be socially useful (371)

            <br>Lebeziatnikov is presented as a hipocrite: he claims feminism and beats Katerina
            <br>Lebeziatnikov is miopic, blind.  He sees Luzhin's generosity (he gives 10 rubles and puts 100 in Sonia's pocket).  He believes Luzhin is generous.
            <br><i>Sees</i> is in italics (376)
            <br>stupid: Lebeziatnikov "respects" Luzhin for his generosity(364-365, 377)
