        <ul>
            <li>Chapter 1 Servants
                <br>Grigory and Marfa bring up all children
                <br>has a six-fingured child (95)
                <br>hates Adelaida, like Sofia(94)

            </li>

            <li>Chapter 2 Stinking Lizaveta
            <br>holy fool (96)
            <br>raped by Fedor
            <br>son <a href="https://axprok.github.io/tenretni/pages/courseSyllabi/rusn397/masiutinBKSmerdiakov.html">Smerdyakov</a>, born in a bathouse (96)

            </li>

            <li>Chapter 3 The Confession of an Ardent Art.  In Verse.
                <br>key to the “Karamazov nature” — sensual, self-tormenting.
                <br>this confession is a moral act: Mitya’s honesty is the first step toward possible redemption.  He admits his guilt (what happened?)
                <br>It contrasts Mitya’s emotional confession with Ivan’s later rational confession (The Grand Inquisitor). (distopia)
                <br>Alyosha’s role is that of empathic listener — the one to whom others reveal their souls.  
                <br>"No, man is broad, even too broad, I would narrow him down" (108).   
            </li>

            <br>Mitia: "money is an accessory, a fever of the soul, an ambience" (108).
            <br>Mitia: "my insect sensuality" (109)
            <br>Mitia: "Ivan knows everything... but Ivan is a grave" (110)
            <br>Mitia: Katerina is proud and virtuous (111)
            <br>Mitia's offer: "Why don't you send me your institute girl?" for money to save her father (112). A demo of Mitia's insect sensuality. A Sonia narrative.
            <br>When Katerina comes, Mitia torments her first (bastard 113-14) then gives her money and let's her go (114).
            <br>
            <br>Money in this chapter:

            <br>Fedor prepared 3K to buy Grushenka (120)
            <br>Smerdiakov know and Mitia knows
            <br>Mitia is "keeping a secret watch" to stop Grushenka and he says to Alesha he might kill Fedor (122)

        <li>Chapter 6. Smerdyakov
            <br>Fedor calls him Balaam's ass (from Numbers 22-24) (123)

        <li>Chapter 7 Disputation
            <br>Smerdyakov uses twisted logic to prove that renouncing faith is а little sin (130)
            <br>Sm does this for Ivan (to win his support as Fedor says) (128)
            <br>Sm. is Balaam's ass for Ivan to show him where his rationalism leads him.  Smerdiakov comes to dinner more often after Ivan arrived to the house (127).

        </li>

        <li>Chapter Eight. Over the Cognac
            <br>Father with Ivan and Alesha
            <br>talk about the existence of God: Ivan: no God, Alesha: there is (134)
            <br>Fedor talks to Alesha about sex with Sofia and how he spat on icons in her presence.  Alesha replicates Sofia's sufferings.
            <br>Fedor forgets that Sofia was also Ivan's mother (138)
            <br>Dmitri rushes in to interrupt the revelation that Ivan is cut off divine wisdom.
