            <li>Chapter 3 The Confession of an Ardent Art.  In Verse.
                <br>key to the “Karamazov nature” — sensual, self-tormenting.
                <br>this confession is a moral act: Mitya’s honesty is the first step toward possible redemption.  He admits his guilt (what happened?)
                <br>It contrasts Mitya’s emotional confession with Ivan’s later rational confession (The Grand Inquisitor). (distopia)
                <br>Alyosha’s role is that of empathic listener — the one to whom others reveal their souls.  
                <br>"No, man is broad, even too broad, I would narrow him down" (108).   
            </li>
