        <h4>Book 9. Chapter 4 The Second Torment. Notes</h4>

                <ul>
                <li>The second torment is HUMILIATION, 
                <br>he has to talk about debt
                <br>of telling them where he got the money
                </li>

                <li>Russian Orthodox belief that for 40 days after one’s death the soul is tormented by the evil spirits.  
                <br>The Preliminary investigation, according to Dostoevsky, is not unlike the torments by the evil spirits.  
                <br>Hence, the prosecutor and the DA are the prime evil spirits.  
                <br>Three torments and three tormentors: 
                <br>Police officer Mikhail Makarovich, <br>Prosecutor Ippolit Kirillovich, and 
                <br>the DA Nikolai Neliudov
                </li>

                <li>good Kahoot material: Id the speaker: "I'm the wolf, you're the hunters--so hunt the wolf down" (471).
                </li>
