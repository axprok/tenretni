        <h4>Epilogue</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Chapter 1. Plans for Mitia's escape
                <br>Alesha connects the characters again.  This is God.
                
                <br>Katerina and Ivan's escape plan is fixing the world that God fucked up.
                <br>Ivan provides 10000 to pay for the fixing (cf. Raskolnikov's plans to be charitable).
                <br>Katerina Ivanovna's confession to Alesha
                <br>KI: I am guilty because I slandered him in order to hurt him (759).
                <br>She is still the infernal woman.
                <br>She speaks with wounded pride and "venom" toward Alesha (759).
                <br>Alesha convinces Katerina to visit Mitya. A. fulfills his major narrative/ideological function.
            </li>

            <li>Chapter 2. For a Moment the Lie Became Truth.
                <br>satire: Trifon searches for money that the prosecution claimed Mitya hid in his restaurant in the crawl space (the lower class version of the Underground man) (762)
                <br>Mitia's insane plan to escape to America in order to return to Russia (765)
                <br>"Katya suddenly appeared in the doorway" (765)
                <br>
                "they prattled to each other, and their talk was frantic, almost senseless ... at that moment everything was truth" (766)
                <br>Katia asks for forgiveness from Grushenka (767)  Grusha says: 'It was her proud lips speaking, not her heart' (767).  
                <br>ab. Katerina: "her eyes flashed with savage wickedness" (767).

            </li>

            <li>Chapter 3.  Ilyushechka's Funeral. Speech at the Stone
                <br>God is connectedness, feel of relatedness.  This is Alesha's role in the novel.
                <br>the opposite is Rakitin: science and domination (what Rakitin teaches to Kolya)
                <br>Alesha's speech, short and simple, not logical and manipulative like the lawyers at the trial: "He felt honor and his father's bitter offense made him rise up" (774).  Cf. Mitia and Ivan letting Sm. murder his father.
                <br>neglected children theme: Alesha--there is nothing higher than a memory from the parental home (774).
                <br>founding a community at the stone and creating a sacred memory (note this is something about which you cannot laugh).
                <br>Nietsche btw defines sacred as something about which you cannot laugh: for example a sacred, cherished memory
                <br>"Memory eternal!" the boys again joined in (776)
