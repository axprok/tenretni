        <h4>The Brothers Karamazov.  Book 1 A Shrieking Disease (13-14)</h4>

        <p>
            In Literature and Culture

Writers like Charles Dickens, Wilkie Collins, and Fyodor Dostoevsky 
<br>described “shriekers” as figures of madness or moral torment. The sound of shrieking symbolized:

Inner torment made audible

The loss of reason and social restraint

The horror of confinement or guilt

For example, in asylum scenes or prison passages, “shrieking” often marks the border between sanity and madness, or between the human and the dehumanized.

<br>Modern Reinterpretation

Today, we would understand those “shriekers” as people experiencing:

Psychotic agitation

Panic attacks

Severe trauma reactions

Neurological conditions causing vocal outbursts

Their behavior, once pathologized and stigmatized as “shrill” or “mad,” is now seen as a symptom requiring compassionate, clinical response rather than a label of identity.
