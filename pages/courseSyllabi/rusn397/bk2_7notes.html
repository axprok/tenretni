        <h4>The Brothers Karamazov.  
            <br>Book 2, Chapter 7 notes
            <br>A Seminarist-Careerist
        </h4>

        <li>
                <br>Mikhail Rakitin is a foil of Alesha (cynic vs. a sincere character)
                <br>a modern type: an intellectual who will go either way: a career in the church (without faith) or
                <br> a career as a fashionable journalist-socialist in St. Petersburg (82)
                <br>tempts Alesha to start speaking sarcastically with venom instead of love and empathy
                <br>Rakitin is the first imp-like character Alesha runs into after Zosima tells him to leave the monastery and be near both brothers (77)
                <br>Rakitin prevents Alesha to be next to both borthers.
                <br>Rakitin hates Zosima.
                <br>Rakitin says that you can have a rule of law without God, without the immortality of soul (82).
