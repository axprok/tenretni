<ul>General Ideas for the Film Adaptations — Key Concepts to Study
<li>1. What Makes a “Dostoevskian” Film?
•	Fragmented narration
•	Psychological doubling
•	Confessional monologues
•	Scandal scenes
•	Crisis of faith vs. rationalism
•	Focus on extreme situations and moral testing</li>
<li>2. Key Questions for Studying Adaptations
•	Does the film preserve narrative structure, or does it alter it?  How?
•	How does the adaptation translate inner monologue into visual storytelling?
•	Does the film maintain Dostoevsky’s religious and philosophical themes, or shift them toward politics, psychology, or existentialism? 
•	How does the protagonist’s moral journey change? Redemption? Irony? Despair?</li>

3. Comparing Novel and Film
Be prepared to discuss:
•	Changes in character motivation
•	Differences in closure (optimistic/bleak; spiritual/secular)
•	New cultural contexts (exotic orientalist Russia, 1970s NYC, bureaucratic dystopias)
•	Narrative tone: serious, serio-comic: dark comedy, satire, noir
</li>
