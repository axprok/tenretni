        <h4>Book 4 Strains (aka Lacerations).
            <br>Notes</h4>

            <p>
                <b>The meaning of the title.</b>  
                <br>Many characters created their own premeditated image (our of pride, humiliations, etc.) and 
                <br>try to live up to this image.  
                <br>Fedor-buffoon, KI—martyr to virtue, Dmitri—insect, which pursues sensual lust, Ivan—Grand Inquisitor (builds Theocracy (universal justice) without God).  
                <br>The point is everyone plays his role badlym, fails to live up to their and world’s expectations and
                <br>sooner or later must face crisis and redefine himself, be able to change.  
                <br>Book 4 is a collection of spiritually wounded people.
                </p>

                <p>In <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>, the concept of "strain" is a key manifestation of wounded pride, also translated as "laceration" or "rupture" in some editions. 

                <br>It refers to the self-inflicted psychological wound that arises from a deeply bruised ego. Instead of healing, the character nurtures this pain, allowing it to twist their perceptions, torment themselves, and lash out at others.
                <br>This theme is explored through several characters, who wear their emotional wounds as a perverse, prideful badge of honor.

                <p>
                <br>Dostoevsky would describe Body Image as a strain that people impose on themselves because of social pressures of patriarchy.  
                <br>Dostoevsly would hate me for invoking patriarchy.  I am sure. :)
