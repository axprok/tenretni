    <h4>CP. Part 6. Notes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Chapter 1
                
                <br>Raskolnikov visits Sonia and meets Svidrigailov at Sonia's. 
                <br>Sv offers false fresh air (440)
                <br>back to his room: Razumikhin tells him about Dunia receiving a letter (from Sv?), 
                <br>R's mom getting sick but telling them that Sonia is R's fiancee (fool in Christ knows) (443)
                <br>Raz makes mistaken judgements about R 
                <br>(he is a "political conspirator", Dunia too, common sense is not enough to understand things) (444)
                <br>Porfiry arrives after common sense (Razumikhin).
            </li>
