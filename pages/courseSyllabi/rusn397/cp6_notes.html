    <h4>CP. Part 6. Notes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Chapter 1
                
                <br>Raskolnikov visits Sonia and meets Svidrigailov at Sonia's. 
                <br>Sv offers false fresh air (440)
                <br>back to his room: Razumikhin tells him about Dunia receiving a letter (from Sv?), 
                <br>R's mom getting sick but telling them that Sonia is R's fiancee (fool in Christ knows) (443)
                <br>Raz makes mistaken judgements about R 
                <br>(he is a "political conspirator", Dunia too, common sense is not enough to understand things) (444)
                <br>Porfiry arrives after common sense (Razumikhin).

            </li>

            <li>Chapter 2 The third Interview with Porfiry (3.0)
                <br>In Raskolnikov's room (like Svidrigailov at the beginning of Part IV, p. 281)
                <br>both visit to make an offer 
                <br>(to go on a journey of pleasure, to confess and suffer)
                <br>
                <br>Porfiry confesses to R that he searched his apartment, he tried to entrap him
                <br>P tells R about Mykola (the <b>schismatic</b> who craves for sufferring) (454)
                <br>P tells R that he is ill
                <br>P says that it is a modern illness, a modern case: a theory, a promise of the life of comfort, a moral license to shed blood that "refreshes" (456)
                <br>offers R to confess (458)
                <br>offers air (460) (doubling, dialogizing the meaning of the same words, see Svidrigailov's earlier offer of air (440))
            
                
            </li>

            <li>Chapter 3 at the restaurant: Svidrigailov and Raskolnikov
                <br>
                Svidrigailov insists that R finding running into him is a miracle (466)
                <br>Sv about St. Petersburg: a city that make a strange influence on the soul of man (467)
                <br>Sv's description (468)
                
            </li>
            <li>Chapter 4. at the restaurant (continues)
                <br>Sv. talks about his relations with marfa, Dunia, Parasha,
                <br>marrying a 15 years old (478-479)
                <br>She has a face of Sistine Madonna <br>Sv says that the Sistine Madonna has the "face of a mournful holy fool" (480)
                <br>Dostoevsky's favorite painting
                <br>D gives his favorite painting to Svidrigailov (sensualist villain).
                <br>good question for a Kahoot: Identify the speaker: I like children generally, like them very much" (481).

             <li>Chapter five. Svidrigailov and Dunia
                <br>Sv about R as Shillerian character
                <br>references to “Schiller” (484) is a shorthand for romantic moral idealism — 
                <br>lofty, emotional, and often naïve notions of virtue and goodness.
                <br>Characters who are called “Schillerian” tend to be noble dreamers, 
                <br>detached from harsh reality, guided by pure feeling rather than practical judgment.
                <br>
                <br>Svidrigailov and Dunia
                <br>Sv kills and rapes without remorse (an extraordinary criminal but without a theory: 
                <br>"a single evil and a hundred good deeds" (490)),
                <br>Sv is alone (cf. R) in his being above the law (human and divine).
                <br>He cannot be redeemed.
                <br>Can he be even punished?
                <br>No: Dunia shoots at him and
                <br>miraculously bullets miss him (495)
                <br>By forcing Dunya into this confrontation, 
                <br>Sv is asking her to deliver the justice he cannot give himself — a foreshadowing of his later suicide.

             <li>Chapter 6. 
                <br>Sv. "There are two ways open for RR a bullet in the head, or Siberia" (500).  
             <br>escape to America is obviously a cipher for this bullet.
             <br>money to Sonia (499)
             <br>money to fiancee (501)
