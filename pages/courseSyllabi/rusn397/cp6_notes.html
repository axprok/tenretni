    <h4>CP. Part 6. Notes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Chapter 1
                
                <br>Raskolnikov visits Sonia and meets Svidrigailov at Sonia's. 
                <br>Sv offers false fresh air (440)
                <br>back to his room: Razumikhin tells him about Dunia receiving a letter (from Sv?), 
                <br>R's mom getting sick but telling them that Sonia is R's fiancee (fool in Christ knows) (443)
                <br>Raz makes mistaken judgements about R 
                <br>(he is a "political conspirator", Dunia too, common sense is not enough to understand things) (444)
                <br>Porfiry arrives after common sense (Razumikhin).

            </li>

            <li>Chapter 2 The third Interview with Porfiry (3.0)
                <br>In Raskolnikov's room (like Svidrigailov at the beginning of Part IV, p. 281)
                <br>both visit to make an offer 
                <br>(to go on a journey of pleasure, to confess and suffer)
                <br>
                <br>Porfiry confesses to R that he searched his apartment, he tried to entrap him
                <br>P tells R about Mykola (the schismatic who craves for sufferring) (454)
                <br>P tells R that he is ill
                <br>P says that it is a modern illness, a modern case: a theory, a promise of the life of comfort, a moral license to shed blood that "refreshes" (456)
                <br>offers R to confess (458)
                <br>offers air (460) (doubling, dialogizing the meaning of the same words, see Sv earlier offer of air (440))
