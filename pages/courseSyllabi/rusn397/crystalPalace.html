<p>
In Dostoevsky's <i>Notes from Undergound</i>, The Crystal Palace represents a world built on:

<br>perfect transparency

<br>complete rationality of human behavior

<br>mathematically calculable self-interest

<br>a “final” social harmony in which all desires are satisfied by design
</p>

<p>
The Crystal Palace became a powerful cultural metaphor almost immediately after 1851. Russian radicals—especially Nikolai Chernyshevsky—adopted it as the emblem of a future rational utopia.

In Chernyshevsky’s novel <i>What Is to Be Done?</i> (1863), the Crystal Palace appears as the architectural and ideological symbol of a socialist-futurist paradise, where rational egoism governs all human behavior.

Historically, <a href="https://s-edwards.com/crystal-palace/">the Crystal Palace</a> was a real building constructed in London in 1851 for the Great Exhibition—the world’s first international exposition of industry, science, and modern technology.
