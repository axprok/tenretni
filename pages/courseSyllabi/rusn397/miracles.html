The bottom line:

The “Miracles” (26-25) monologue in “The Elders” chapter:

Reflects on why people seek signs and wonders.

Questions the nature of genuine faith.

Foreshadows the novel’s central philosophical conflict — freedom vs. miracle, reason vs. faith, inner belief vs. external proof.

<br>

Dostoevsky uses the talk of miracles not to affirm their supernatural reality, but to probe the human hunger for certainty — and to suggest that faith without freedom is not faith at all.
<br>The Context

In “The Elders,” the Karamazov family — Fyodor Pavlovich, his sons Dmitri, Ivan, and Alyosha — visit the monastery to meet Elder Zosima, a revered monk and spiritual guide.

Before they meet him, the conversation among the visitors turns to the question of “miracles” and why people go to monks or “elders.”
Fyodor Pavlovich (the father) mocks the custom and the idea of miracles, while others — monks and pilgrims — speak of them reverently.

The “monologue about miracles” comes from a discussion of what draws people to faith: the desire for signs and wonders.

<br>2. The Monologue itself

Here’s the essential idea:

People, says one of the monks (echoed later by Ivan and Zosima in different ways), are drawn to visible miracles — healings, icons that weep, saints whose bodies don’t decay — because they want proof of God.
But true faith is not born of miracles; it must come from the heart, freely, without compulsion.

The monologue paraphrases a Gospel theme (John 20:29):

“Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed.”

Zosima and Alyosha’s perspective will later affirm this kind of faith — not based on spectacle or rational argument, but on love and inner conviction.

<br>Significance

The conversation about miracles introduces a crucial Dostoevskian question:

What kind of faith can survive in a modern, rational, skeptical age?

There are two kinds of faith contrasted:

Type of Faith	Description	Dostoevsky’s View
Faith in miracles	Based on external signs; people want to see wonders and be convinced by force.	Superficial, dependent, unfree.
Faith of the heart	Based on love, humility, and spiritual experience without proof.	True faith; the kind Zosima teaches and Alyosha embodies.

The “miracle” discussion anticipates Ivan’s later arguments (in “The Grand Inquisitor”) — that humanity craves miracles, authority, and bread, because freedom is too heavy a burden.

Thus, this early monologue sets up the theological groundwork for the entire novel.

<br>foreshadowing Later key themes in the Novel

The Grand Inquisitor later accuses Christ of rejecting miracles, and says that the Church had to “correct” Him by giving people what they wanted — miracle, mystery, and authority.

The Elder Zosima embodies the opposite: spiritual life as inner freedom, not miraculous coercion.

The people’s fascination with whether Zosima’s body will “smell of corruption” after death (Book VII) becomes a tragic echo of this same debate: people still crave physical signs of holiness instead of spiritual ones.
