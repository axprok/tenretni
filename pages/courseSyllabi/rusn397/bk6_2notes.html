<ul>

                <li>Life of Zosima, composed by Alexei
                <br>(a) Of the Older Borther Markel
                <br>Markel non-believer who converts before death: 
                <br>"each of us is guilty in everything before everyone" (289).
                </li>
                <li>(b) Zosima about Holy Scripture

                <li>(c) The Duel
                <br>Officer Zinovy refuses to kill at the duel
                <br>"I've become a sort of holy fool" (301).
                </li>

                <li>(d) The Mysterious Visitor

                <br>Zosima repeats the Epigraph from John
                <br>“It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.” (309)
                <br>the Epistle to the Hebrews 10:31 in the New Testament.
                <br>the verse expresses awe before God’s living and active power — His justice, holiness, and the inevitability of divine judgment. 
                <br>When Zosima  cites it, it  carries both fear and reverence: 
                <br>the idea that standing before the living God is overwhelming, because 
                <br>He sees into every heart and repays truthfully — 
                <br>yet it also implies trust and surrender to God’s will.
                <br>"I threw myself on my knees before the icon and wept for him to the most holy Mother of God" (310)
                <br>"It was the first time he called me "friend" (310)
                <br>In Russian: "В первый раз мне ты сказал."
                <br>"I came to kill you" (312).
                <br>The mysterious visitor's name was Mikhail (312).
