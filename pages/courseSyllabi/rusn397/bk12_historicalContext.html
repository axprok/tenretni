        <h4>Book 12. Historical Context</h4>

<p>
<b>Judicial Reform of Alexander II (1864)</b><br>
The main results were the introduction of a unified judicial system instead of a cumbersome set of estates of the realm courts, and fundamental changes in criminal trials. The latter included the establishment of the principle of equality of the parties involved, the introduction of public hearings, the jury trial, and a professional advocate that had never existed in Russia.
