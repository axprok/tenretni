Where and why Dostoevsky mentions ecclesiastical courts?

<br>On p. 17 and in Book 12

<br>1 During Dmitri’s trial, the defense attorney (Fetyukovich) contrasts church justice with secular justice, asking implicitly:

Should the judgment of the human soul belong to the state or to God?

The ecclesiastical court represents an ideal of moral and spiritual judgment — a tribunal that cares about repentance, conscience, and salvation, not merely external acts.
The secular court, by contrast, represents the new, Westernized, rational-legal order — focused on evidence, social order, and punishment.

So when canon law or ecclesiastical justice are invoked, Dostoevsky is posing a moral-philosophical question:

Can true justice exist without a belief in the soul and in divine law?

<br>2. The Deeper Meaning in the Novel

The trial of Mitya is a parody of true judgment — it becomes a theatrical, public spectacle.
In contrast, the “ecclesiastical court” symbolizes the inner court of conscience, the “tribunal of the heart” that Alyosha and Father Zosima represent.

Zosima’s teaching — that “each of us is guilty before all, and for all” — is the essence of spiritual justice, not legal justice.
Thus, ecclesiastical justice in the novel points toward:

Forgiveness over punishment

Repentance over retribution

Communal moral responsibility over individual blame

<br>3. Broader Historical Context

In 19th-century Russia, there was an ongoing debate over whether moral and spiritual questions should be handled by church authority or the modern secular state.
Dostoevsky, through the Karamazov trial, dramatizes the loss of the spiritual foundation of justice.
He suggests that without the idea of a divine, moral order — canon law as a symbol of divine justice — the new legal system becomes mechanical, rhetorical, and ultimately blind.
