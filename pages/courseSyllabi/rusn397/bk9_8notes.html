            <p> 
                <br>title of the chapter: The Evidence of the Witnesses.  The Wee One (Дитё in Russian).
                <br>the meaning of the title: two different dimensions: money vs. soul salvation
                <br>the main question is 3000 rubles
                <br>vs. the main concern for Mitya--love ("a tenderness such as never known before" (508) + Grushenka)
                <br>witness 1: Trifon 2 parties 6K total (501)
                <br>interrogators rejoice at 6K testimony (501)
                <br>witness 2: Kalganov 6K
                <br>witness 3: Pan Mussylovich: Mitya offered to buy him out for 3K (502)
                <br>witness 4: Maximov Mitya had 20000 rubles (504)
                <br>witness 5: Grushenka first party was for 3000 rubles, never heard about 1500 rubles (505).
                <br>
                <br>Mitya's dream: "I had a good dream gentlemen" : "a tenderness such as he has never known before" (508).
                The word for tenderness is "umilenie" in Russian the same as for the genre of the icon "Tender Mercy."
