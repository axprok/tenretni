    <ul>
        <li>chapter 1
            <br>R lives in the closet, cupboard under the roof of a five-storied house (3)
            <br>ill hypochondria (3)
        </li>

        

        <li>chapter 2
            <br>Marmeladov's confession (pp. 15-24): man is a scoundrel, need to repent but this man will be saved by our Lord
            <br>Marmeladov has a family despite being a scoundrel. R is alone
            <br>R leaves money for M's family even though he has no money himself (moved by M's confession) (27)
            <br>R: his theory man is not a scoundrel (God himself) and does not need God as a barrier against crime (27).
        </li>

        <li>Chapter 3
            <br>Mother's letter to Rodya (confession) (30-39)
            <br>about Svidrigailov's harassment
            <br>about Dunya selling herself for Rodya (60 rubles instead of 30 rubles for Sonia)
            <br>R cries: R's face was wet with tears (41).

        </li>

        <li>Chapter 4
            <br>R compares Sonia to Dunia
            <br>R sees a drunk girl and gives 20 kopecks to a policeman to save her to escape a rapist, then changes his mind (schism: reason wins over his love) (48)
            <br>goes to Vasilyevsky Island to Razumikhin (a sociable and simlistic fellow (52)), lives on the rooftop (52)
        </li>

        <li>Chapter 5
            <br>Longing for Razumikhin but getting a terrible dream
            <br>Dream 1 about killing a horse (54-59)
            <br>It’s a foreshadowing, a rehearsal of Raskolnikov’s crime, 
            <br>played out in his dreams before he commits it. 
            <br>Each figure (the mare, Mikolka, the crowd, the child) 
            <br>externalizes part of his inner split — 
            <br>compassion vs. cruelty, conscience vs. ideology. 
            <br>The dream questions his theory: 
            <br>his heart will not allow him to live with the reality of violence.
            <br>
            <br>Eavesdropping: R overhears at the Haymarket 
            <br>that Lizaveta will be absent in the apartment at 7PM tomorrow.

        </li>

        <li>
        Chapter 6
            <br>axe not as planned from the kitchen, from caretaker's closet
            <br>dream #3 city planning: St. Petersburg
            <br>"his reason was clouded" (74)
        <li>
        Chapter 7
            <br>door is open while R is murdering people, a failure of reason
            <br>Everything is happening by chance or "as if by design" (85)
            <br>after the murders, "He met no one, not a single soul" (86)
        </li>
