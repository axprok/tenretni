        <h4>Book 5 Notes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Chapter 1. Betrothal. 
                <br>Lise and Alesha
                <br>Alesha kisses her (218)
                <br>Lise's confession: she will spy on Alesha, like her mom
                <br>Alesha: "Maybe I don't believe in God" (220).
                <br>Lise's letter: declaration of love.

            </li>

            <li>Chapter 2. Smerdyakov with a Guitar
                <br>Alesha is lookign for Dimitri to prevent the murder.
                <br>Alesha eavesdrops Semrdiakov's ideas:
                <br>"I'd have let them kill me in the womb" (224)  Good Kahoot material.
                <br>"I hate all of Russia" (225)
                <br>He wishes Napoleon conquered Russia in 1812.
                <br>coincidence/miracle: Alesha sneezes
                <br>Smerdyakov says that he didn't see Dmitri, that he is not his keeper.
                <br>Smerdiakov sends Alesha to the Metropolis restaurant where Ivan is alone (he is alone by his rationality).
                <br>Alesha is directed by Smerdyakov away from Dimitri

            </li>

            <li>Chapter 3. The Bros Get Acquainted.
                <br>Ivan and Alesha
                <br>Ivan confesses to Alesha:
                <br>Ivan does not accept the world of God's (235).
            </li>

            <li>Chapter 4.  Rebellion
                <br>Ivan confesses to Alesha
                <br>I return God my ticket (245)
                <br>Confession is an attack on Alesha's faith
                <br>if God allows children to suffer, man has to use violence, since God fails to protect the innocent (story of the landowner using dogs to kill a child (243))
                <br>Ivan: "I somehow have a headache" (238).
            </li>
            <li>Chapter 5. Poem. The Grand Inquisitor.
            <br>Doubling: this poem is a confession of Ivan 
            <br>juxtaposed to the Confession of Dmitri in Book III.
            </li>
