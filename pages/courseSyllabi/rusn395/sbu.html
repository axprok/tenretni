<figcaption>Fig.1. Ukraine: Monument next to the SBU HQ depicting a cossack fighting a double-headed dragon crawling into Eastern Ukraine and touching with its tail Crimea.  Unveiled in 2016.  Note that the Ukrainian monument avoids Soviet and Russian-style monumentalism (cf. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Motherland_Calls">Motherland Calls</a> in Volgograd).  A good question for the final exam would be: how do you read/interpret this Ukrainian monument in the current geopolitical situation?  Why is the dragon two-headed?  Why is the warrior is depicted as a cossack?</figcaption>
