<h3>The Smiley Franchise</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
a series of nine (i think) novels by John le Carré.</li>

<li>George Smiley is described as short, balding, overweight, and bespectacled, and often allows others to mistreat him.  His wife sleeps with another and he cannot do anything about it.  Smiley is the </li>
<li>Smiley is often referred to as "anti-Bond."  He is intellectual and not an action hero.</li>

<li>First appears in the novel by Le Carre <i>Call for the Dead</i>(1961).</li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>The Call for the Dead</i> opens with the following paragraph: 
<br>
"When Lady Ann Sercomb married George Smiley towards the end of the war she described him to her astonished Mayfair friends as breathtakingly ordinary. When she left him two years later in favour of a Cuban motor racing driver, she announced enigmatically that if she hadn’t left him then, she never could have done; and Viscount Sawley made a special journey to his club to observe that the cat was out of the bag." 
<br>

This is somewhat different from the sexual adventures of James Bond.
<br>
<br>
Sidney Lumet directed a film adaptation of the novel <i>The Deadly Affair</i>(Columbia Pictures 1967).  The central character is renamed Charles Dobbs because Paramount owned the rights to the name George Smiley.  Astrud Gilberto performs a song "Who Needs Forever."  Music in the film is by Quincy Jones.  Love it!
