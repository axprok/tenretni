<h3>The George Smiley Franchise</h3>

<p>
George Smiley is a British intelligence officer who works for <a href="circus.html">"The Circus"</a>. <a href="lecarre.html">John Le Carré</a>'s <i>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</i> is a Smiley novel only tangengially. Smiley appears in it as an episodic character.

<ul>
	<li>
The Smiley franchise is a series of nine (I think) novels by John Le Carré.</li>

<li>George Smiley is described as short, balding, overweight, and bespectacled, and often allows others to mistreat him.  His wife sleeps with another man and Smiley cannot do anything about it.  
 </li>
<li>Smiley is often referred to as "anti-Bond."  He is intellectual and not an action hero.</li>

<li>First appears in the novel by Le Carré <i>Call for the Dead</i>(1961).</li>
</ul>

<p>
<i>The Call for the Dead</i> opens with the following paragraph: 
<br>
"When Lady Ann Sercomb married George Smiley towards the end of the war <br>she described him to her astonished Mayfair friends <br>as breathtakingly ordinary. <br>When she left him two years later in favour of a Cuban motor racing driver,<br>she announced enigmatically that if she hadn’t left him then,<br> she never could have done;<br> and Viscount Sawley made a special journey to his club<br> to observe that the cat was out of the bag." 
<br>

This is somewhat different from the sexual adventures of James Bond.
<br>
<br>
Sidney Lumet directed a film adaptation of the novel <i>The Deadly Affair</i> (Columbia Pictures 1967).  The central character is renamed Charles Dobbs because Paramount owned the rights to the name George Smiley.  <br>Astrud Gilberto performs a song "Who Needs Forever."  Music in the film is by Quincy Jones.  Love it!
