<h4>Len Deighton</h4>

<p>
Len Deighton is a British author best known for his spy novels, particularly those set during the Cold War. He was born in 1929 and rose to fame in the 1960s, becoming one of the most prominent figures in the genre alongside writers like Ian Fleming and John le Carré.

His Most Famous Spy Novel:
His most famous work is "The IPCRESS File" (1962), which was his debut novel. It introduced an unnamed protagonist (later known as "Harry Palmer" in film adaptations) and established a more gritty, cynical, and realistic take on espionage compared to the glamorous world of James Bond.

"The IPCRESS File" is known for:

Its dry wit and ironic tone

Bureaucratic realism in the world of spies

A nameless anti-hero who became a cult figure

The book was also turned into a popular 1965 film starring Michael Caine as the protagonist, which helped cement both the character and Deighton’s style in popular culture.
