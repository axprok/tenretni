<h3>Neo-Noir and Human Rights: Operation Hyacinth (dir. Piotr Domalewski 2021)</h3>

<p>
Operation Hyacinth, an operation undertaken by the Polish secret services (The SB) in the 1980s. The operation targeted the country's gay community, and the material gathered was used to extort men and to enforce their cooperation. Launched under the pretext of tackling the AIDS epidemic and prostitution, Operation Hyacinth saw a significant number of homosexuals imprisoned, arrested, or otherwise persecuted.

<p>
The protagonist has to go rogue in order to preserve his integrity.  He becomes a private eye investigating corruption in his own organization on his own.  His own family is as corrupt as the police force.  Arek is an interesting turn on the femme fatale trope.  Instead of destroying the lead character, Arek helps Robert to understand his own identity.  BTW, Arek is short of Arkadius.  Arcadia is a poetic term associated with bountiful natural splendor and harmony (Utopia).

Note that Eastern European noir often deals with the controversial moment in national history.  Cf. Lithuanian <i>Isaac</i> (2019) examining Lithuanians participating in the Holocaust.
