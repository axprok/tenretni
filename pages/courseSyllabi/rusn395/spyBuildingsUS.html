        <figcaption>Fig. 1. The original OSS/CIA headquarters above <br>was located at 2430 E Street NW, on the site of the US Navy Bureau of Medicine and Surgery. CIA headquarters was relocated to a new building at Langley, VA, in the 1960s. The front part of the building shown was demolished for freeway construction in the 1970s. Its southern remainder and two buildings behind are supposedly still in use by the CIA and State Department intelligence and counterterrorism. In 1960 gates were left open, now the site is guarded (source https://cryptome.org/eyeball/ciaest/ciaest-birdseye.htm.</figcaption>
