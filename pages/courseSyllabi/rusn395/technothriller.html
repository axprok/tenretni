<h3>Techno-thriller</h3>


<p>The genre gained popularity with the release of Tom Clancy's <i>The Hunt for Red October</i> (US Naval Institute Press, 1984)
There are three variants of the genre: <br>(1) military/spy thriller (Tom Clancy's novels: The Ryanverse franchise), <br>(2) sci-fi (often biotechnology like Michael Crighton's Jurassic Park (1990)), <br>(3) crypto-techno-thrillers (the drama unfold most of the time online).
<br>

<br>
Overlaps at times with the spy-fi genre.

<p>
	<i>The Hunt for Red October</i> (1984).  Key themes: (1) procedural: the workings of military and intel institutions, (2) details of naval technology, (3) trust: US institutions and servicemen have it and Soviets do not, (4) Jack Ryan is a model spy (both analyst and action hero, in contrast to Bond, a family man).

<p>
The dialogue that triggers the main action of the film: Ramius and his crew defecting to the West to prevent the nuclear Armageddon.
<br>
[Captain Ramius has entered his personal quarters to see the political officer, Ivan Putin, reading his Bible]
<br>
Ivan Putin: [reading, in Russian] "Behold, I am coming as a thief... and he gathered them all together in a place called Armageddon... [English] and the Seventh Angel poured forth his bowl into the air, and a voice cried out from Heaven, saying, "It is done!" A man of your responsibilities reading about the end of the world? 
<br>
And what's this? "I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."
<br>
Ramius: It is an ancient Hindu text, quoted by an American.
<br>
Putin: An American?
<br>
Ramius: Mmm. He invented the atomic bomb. He was later accused of being a communist.

<p>
Jack Ryan is a former U.S. Marine and stockbroker who becomes a history teacher at the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland. <br>Ryan later joins the Central Intelligence Agency as analyst and occasional field officer, eventually leaving it as Deputy Director. He later served as National Security Advisor and Vice President before suddenly becoming President of the United States following a terrorist attack on the United States Capitol. <br>Ryan went on to serve two non-consecutive terms and mostly dealt with international crises in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Africa.
