<h3>Techno-thriller</h3>


<p>The genre gained popularity with the release of Tom Clancy's <i>The Hunt for red October</i>(1984)
There are three variants of the genre: <br>(1) military/spy thriller (Tom Clancy's novels: The Ryanverse franchise), <br>(2) sci-fi (often biotechnology like Michael Crighton's Jurassic Park (1990)), <br>(3) crypto-techno-thrillers (the drama unfold most of the time online).

Overlaps at times with the spy-fi genre.
