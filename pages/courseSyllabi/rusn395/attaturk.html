<p>
Mustafa Kemal Attaturk abolished the Ottoman sultanate in 1922 and proclaimed the foundation of the Turkish Republic in its place the following year.

<p>
In our course, Attaturk appears as a target of the assasination attempt by Dimitrios Macropoulos in Eric Ambler's <i>Coffin for Dimitrios</i>.  The novel is set in the countries that formed on the ruins of the Ottoman Empire on the eve of the new world war (1938-39).  The instability, crime, and corruption define the atmosphere of the novel.  The lead character Charles Latimer chases the evasive criminal Dimitrios through the labyrinth of the ephemeral nation states. The atmosphere noir (crime, corruption, paranoia).  Unstable identity of the criminal, Dimitrios, mirrors the instability of pre-WW2 Europe.
