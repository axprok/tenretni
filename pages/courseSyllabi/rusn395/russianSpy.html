    <h4>The Russian Spy Novel</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Boris Akunin is the major practitioner (the genre emerged after the end of communism and the rise of commerical print culture in the 1990s free Russia.</li>

    <li>Fandorin is the faithful servant of the Russian empire (conservative views, ironic about new ideas (feminism in Turkish Gambit)</li>
    <li>novels are set in the times of Alexander II (reformist tsar)</li>
    <li>Akunin borrows from the historical novel: chance encounter, use of foreign words (Turkish, Romanian, etc.) for the local color, hero in between two fighting camps</li>

    <li>Akunin likes to use playful references to other literary and cinematic works.  In Turkish Gambit, officer Zurov is a reference to a character in Pushkin's Captain's Daughter. The Ottoman Empire as a setting is an homage to numerous spy novels set on the ruins of the Ottoman Empire (Coffin for Dimitrios, From Russia with Love etc.).  Fandorin's last name is a reference to French Fantomas crime series from the early 20th century by  writers Marcel Allain (1885–1969) and Pierre Souvestre (1874–1914) where one of the lead character's name is Fandor. Journalist Jerôme Fandor, is employed at the newspaper La Capitale.</li>
