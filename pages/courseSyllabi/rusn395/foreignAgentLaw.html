		<h4>
		Rusn 395. the 2012 Russian Foreign Agent Law.
		</h4>

     
<p>
The Russian foreign agent law (2012) requires anyone who receives support from outside Russia or is under influence from outside Russia to register and declare themselves as foreign agents. Once registered, they are subject to additional audits and are obliged to mark all their publications with a 24-word disclaimer saying that they are being distributed by a "foreign agent". The phrase "foreign agent" (Russian: иностранный агент) in Russian has strong associations with Cold War-era espionage. The law has been heavily criticized both in Russia and internationally as violating human rights and suppressing civil society.
