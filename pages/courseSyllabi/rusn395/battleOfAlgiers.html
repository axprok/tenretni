    <h4>Battle of Algiers (1966)</h4>

    <p>
    Gillo Pontecorvo's <i>Battles of Algiers</i> is an art house docudrama.  The film also sembraces such elements of montage cinema as the collective hero (the nation, the colonial master), typage acting, intellectual montage (visual and sound).  I do not think this film of decolonization is a third cinema film (experimental formally but distirbuted thru traditional networks of Europena art cinema, got all kind of festival awards).

    The film includes elements of the spy film, particularly in its portrayal of covert operations and counterinsurgency tactics, passing (being perceived by others as belonging to a different social group than the one with which they may identify), moral ambiguity, creating a sense of suspense.

    In 2003, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/07/weekinreview/the-world-film-studies-what-does-the-pentagon-see-in-battle-of-algiers.html">Michael Kaufman wrote</a> "Challenged by terrorist tactics and guerrilla warfare in Iraq, the Pentagon recently held a screening of ''The Battle of Algiers,'' the film that in the late 1960's was required viewing and something of a teaching tool for radicalized Americans and revolutionary wannabes opposing the Vietnam War."

    It is a film about a nationalist revolution against the colonial empire.  In this sense, it is a film about the collective hero (the nation) who is an enemy within the empire.  The French viewed Algeria as the department of the republic while Algerian nationalists identified themselves as a sovereign nation.

    Gnawa music, especially the thunderous qraqeb and pounding tabl, heightens tension in the scene when the three women prepare to plant bombs in the European neighborhood of Algiers by removing their veils, altering their appearance, and donning European clothes. The intense percussion underscores the gravity of their mission.

    Here are the political thrillers inspired by Pontecorvo's film. <i>Zero Dark Thirty</i> (2012, dir. Kathryn Bigelow).  Though focused on modern counterterrorism, the filmâ€™s use of surveillance, intelligence-gathering, and moral ambiguity echoes The Battle of Algiers.  Also see <i>Munich</i> (Spielberg 2005).  <i>Omar</i> (Hany Abu-Assad 2013).
