            <li>Humor: Saved by the sacred scriptures (joke)</li>
            <li>McGuffin. The MacGuffin technique is common in films, especially thrillers. Usually, the MacGuffin is revealed in the first act, and thereafter declines in importance. It can reappear at the climax of the story but may actually be forgotten by the end of the story</li>
            <li>Suspense</li>
            <li>Icy Blonde</li>
            <li>Technology as a visual attraction.  In Hitchcock's film: aerogyro, trains, secret is silent airplane engine, the Forth Bridge in Scotland.
