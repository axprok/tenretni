    An empress of Russia, expanded the empire eastward into Central Asia and westward by annexing Ukraine, Poland, Lithuania, Crimea.  For our course what matters is her function in the historical novel, that is in <i>Captain's Daughter</i>.  She is in the background of the plot.  She fulfills the function of a helper at the end of the narrative.  Just like Emelyan Pugachev.  She is not unlike Deus ex machina in ancient Greek drama.  Second, the action of the novel is set during her rule (about 60 years prior to the time of publication).  Pushkin here follows Walter Scott's convention.
