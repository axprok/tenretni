<h4>The Orient Express</h4>

<p>
Fleming wrote FRWL inspired by trhe story of Eugene Karp and his journey on the Orient Express. Karp was a US naval attach√© and intelligence agent based in Budapest who, in February 1950, took the Orient Express from Budapest to Paris, carrying a number of papers about blown US spy networks in the Eastern Bloc. Soviet assassins were already on the train. The conductor was drugged and Karp's body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of Salzburg.
