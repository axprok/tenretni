Ian Fleming wrote FRWL inspired by the story of Eugene Karp and his journey on the Orient Express. Karp was a US naval attach√© and intelligence agent based in Budapest who, in February 1950, took the Orient Express from Budapest to Paris, carrying a number of papers about blown US spy networks in the Eastern Bloc.
