In <i>Austin Powers</i>, the use of the same actor for the roles of the gentleman spy and his archnemesis is a running sight gag.

<p>
postmodernist genre:
<br>
1 Namely, deconstruction via collapsing the binary: the same actor plays heroic super-agent and the villainous Dr. Evil.
<br>
2. Another example of collapsing the binary, in this case gender binary, is the figure of the fembot in Austin Powers.  It is a grotesque fusion of the woman as sexual object in Hollywood cinema and phallic masculine technology.  The fembot in Austin Powers is a literal parody—beautiful, seductive, and deadly. Fembots nipples are at the same time gun barrels.  It makes fun of both Bond girls and the trope of the femme fatale, showing how absurd the expectations around femininity can be.
<br>
Postmodernism loves to mash things up— parodying, and reworking earlier texts and genres. Fembots often appear in sci-fi, horror, and action genres, and they parody both the genres themselves and the social roles they represent.
