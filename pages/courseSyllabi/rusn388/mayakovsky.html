        <p>Mayakovsky revolutionized poetic language and rebeled against the status quo. 
        <br>A devoted socialist, he joined the revolutionary Bolshevik Party in 1908. For several months, Mayakovsky and his comrades opposed the Tsarist regime in the streets of Moscow. 
        <br>For instance, they organized the biggest escape from a female prison in Russia’s history. 
        <br>In Mayakovsky’s case, police caught the young revolutionary and put him behind bars for 11 months.</p>
