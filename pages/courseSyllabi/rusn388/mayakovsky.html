        <h4>Vladimir Mayakovsky</h4>

        <p>Mayakovsky revolutionized poetic language and rebeled against the status quo. A devoted socialist, he joined the revolutionary Bolshevik Party in 1908. For several months, Mayakovsky and his homies, I mean comrades, opposed the Tsarist regime in the streets of Moscow. For instance, they organized the biggest escape from a female prison in Russia’s history.In Mayakovsky’s case, the law won. Police caught the young revolutionary and put him behind bars for 11 months.</p>
