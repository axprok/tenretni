        <ul>skaz narration
            <li>author uses a narrator who in their turn use colloquial speech</li>
            <li>first person narrative</li>
            <li>narrator tries to use and fails (to a comic effect) political rhetoric introduced by communist government: "in the theater she exposed her ideology to a full measure"</li>
            <li>The narrator misuses words whose meanings he does not fully understand (for example, he assumes that an “aristocratic woman” is simply someone who owns a hat and has a gold tooth).</li>
