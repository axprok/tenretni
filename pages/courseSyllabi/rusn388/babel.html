		When Babel first began writing the individual stories of Red Cavalry, they were nonfiction recaps of his experiences in the war, published in newspapers.  However, through numerous rewrites, his characters and stories became fictional, and it is still hard to determine which of the stories in the compilation are true memory and which are imagination.  While this collection of stories was immensely popular throughout Russia, Budyonny criticized Babel, saying that his representation of the Cossack army was insulting and inaccurate.

		In <i>Red Cavalry</i>, Kirill Vasilyevich Lyutov follows the course of the Russian Civil War with unsophisticated, uneducated Cossack soldiers.  The reader sees these soldiers wreak a trail of savagery through Russia's Polish territoryfrom the point of view of Lyutov, a Jewish war correspondent and Babel's alter-ego.  The work brings together the tensions that Babel must have experienced while traveling with the Red Army.  Lyutov seems to identify himself as an ethical and honorable Jew, but this identification strictly contrasts the Cossacks’ mechanical devotion to the state.  Lyutov also struggles to be accepted and respected by these primitive and uninhibited men rather than set apart as a weak and intellectual Jew.
