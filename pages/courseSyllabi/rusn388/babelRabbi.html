<h4>Discussion of "The Rabbi."</h4>

<p>
<br>
In the story “The Rabbi,” Gedali utters a prophetic statement about Hasidism, comparing it to the memory of one’s mother. “The memory of one’s mother nourishes compassion within us.” The word compassion—rachamim—literally means “to take into the bosom, into the womb, where it is warm and comfortable and where the mother’s blood nourishes you.” In this, the wise Gedali sees the appeal of Hasidism. “With its eye sockets drained, Hasidism still stands at the crossroads of the winds of history.” An evil revolution, of course, is incompatible with mercy.

Gedali serves as both a spiritual and a physical guide: he leads the hero to Rabbi Motale, “the last rabbi of the Chernobyl dynasty.” The rabbi’s surname, Braslavsky, undoubtedly alludes to the famous Nachman of Bratslav, a Hasidic rabbi and writer. Nachman of Bratslav said, “Now is the time to tell stories.” He also said of one of his tales: “There is not a single word in it that is devoid of meaning. Only one who has grasped the wisdom of the holy books can understand the hints contained in it.” Is this attitude toward the text not a key to Babel? Generations of Jewish children grew up in homes where these tales were read; of course Babel was familiar with them. Nachman of Bratslav had no heir—the son in whom he placed great hopes died.

The surname of the Chernobyl rabbis was Twersky, so what we see here is a composite rabbi, who also combines features of Rabbi Borukh of Medzhybizh. On the way to the rabbi’s “court,” the narrator sees two pregnant Ukrainian peasant women—the embodiment of “mercy.” The rabbi’s house is shattered, like the “edifice of Hasidism” of which Gedali speaks. In this dead house sits the rabbi, wearing a royal sable hat and a white robe. On white, dirt would be especially visible—but there is none. The rabbi’s clothing is clean, as befits a man who studies sacred books.

The rabbi greets the visitor with closed eyes: “Where has the Jew come from?”—that is, he sees people with inner vision. Of the great progenitor of Hasidism, Baal Shem Tov, it was said that with his spiritual eye he saw everything that was happening in the world from one end to the other. Learning that the visitor is from Odessa, the rabbi calls it “the well of our calamities.” The reference is likely to the pit into which the brothers threw Joseph before selling him into slavery—that is, to the betrayal by brothers.

<p>
Asked what he does, the visitor deceives the rabbi: “I versify the adventures of Hersh of Ostropol.” He wants to gain the rabbi’s trust and tempts him with the name of the famous Hersh. Hersh of Ostropol was a jester and conversational partner at the court of Rabbi Borukh of Medzhybizh. Borukh, the grandson of the Baal Shem Tov, was not only the spiritual leader of the community but also fabulously wealthy and lived like a king, riding through the town in a splendid carriage. Dozens of servants and cooks lived at Rabbi Borukh’s court. When receiving guests, he sat in a special hall on a throne. Joy is a commandment of Hasidism, yet Rabbi Borukh suffered bouts of black melancholy, and only Hersh was able to dispel it.

Hersh came from a rabbinical family and was educated, but lack of means prevented him from continuing his studies and becoming a rabbi. His learning nevertheless made him a worthy interlocutor for Rabbi Borukh.

At the same time, Hersh is a folk character, like Hodja Nasreddin—a poor man who mocks greedy rich men and secures his livelihood through cunning.

At Rabbi Motale’s “court” lives the jester Reb Mordkhe (perhaps an allusion to Mordecai at the court of Ahasuerus), a hunchbacked little old man with everted eyelids (damage to the eyes!), reminiscent of the jesters in Velázquez. And when the rabbi says, “Let him drink wine, if they give him wine,” the jester echoes: “Drink the wine that they will not give you.”

This may hint that the narrator says he does things he does not in fact do. Moreover, it is in the spirit of a tale by Nachman of Bratslav, the great-grandson of the Baal Shem Tov—The Wise Man and the Simpleton—where the simpleton, who is in fact a philosopher of life, eats meat he does not have and praises it. The jester’s remark about impoverished sages is in the same vein.

The court of the impoverished king consists of madmen, liars, and gawkers. Suddenly the narrator notices a young man with the face of Baruch Spinoza; he is smoking. He is the rabbi’s son.

Baruch—Benedict Spinoza (1632–1677), the great rationalist philosopher, broke with Judaism and was baptized, though apparently he was an atheist. He smoked a great deal, as did Ilya Braslavsky, believing it would cure him of tuberculosis, from which he suffered for many years and of which he died young.

The jester Mordkhe calls Ilya a cursed son. In a tale by Nachman of Bratslav, “How the King’s Daughter Was Lost,” the king curses his daughter: “Ah, may the unclean one take you,” and she disappears—the unclean spirit takes her. Thus the character of the son is described and a foreshadowing is given.

After the celebration of the Sabbath—the day given for rest—the narrator leaves for his agit-train to work on an unfinished article, violating the Sabbath.
