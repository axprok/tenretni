        <h4>Comparing Mayakovsky tonic poem with 
            <br>what if he wrote his poem in polite syllabo-tonic verse.</h4>

        <p>

            Bad syllabo-tonic English version
<br>(Regular iambic pentameter, smooth, literary, dead on arrival)
<br>I swiftly blurred the map of daily life
<br>With paint that splashed out brightly from a glass.
<br>Upon a silver dish of jellyed meat
<br>I showed the ocean’s cheekbones, sharply drawn.
<br><br>And on the scales of some metallic fish
<br>I read the tender calling of new lips.
<br>Now tell me, could you softly play a tune,
<br>A nocturne on a pipe of flowing drains?
<br><br>What’s wrong here
<br>Predictable da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM
<br>Verbs softened (blurred, showed, play a tune)
<br>Syntax smoothed into literary English
<br>The challenge turns into a gentle invitation
<br>This poem could be read sitting down. That’s for losers and boring middle class goody-goody kids.
<br>
<br>
<br>TONIC version
(Stress-driven, jagged, performative, intentionally uneven)
<br><br>Could you?
<br><br>I-at once—smeared the map of the everyday,
<br>splashing paint from a glass.
<br>I showed--on a dish of aspic--the slanted cheekbones of the ocean.
<br>On the scales of a tin fish
<br>I read the calls of new lips.
<br>And you—
<br>could you
<br>play
<br>a nocturne
<br>on a flute
<br>of drainpipes?
