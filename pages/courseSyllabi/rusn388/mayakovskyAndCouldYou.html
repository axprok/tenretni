        <h4>Vladimir Mayakovsky. And Could You?</h4>

        <p><b>Comparing Mayakovsky tonic poem with 
            <br>what if he wrote his poem in polite syllabo-tonic verse.</b>

            <br>BAD syllabo-tonic English version
<br>(Regular iambic pentameter, smooth, literary, dead on arrival)
<br>I swiftly blurred the map of daily life
<br>With paint that splashed out brightly from a glass.
<br>Upon a silver dish of jellyed meat
<br>I showed the ocean’s cheekbones, sharply drawn.
<br><br>And on the scales of some metallic fish
<br>I read the tender calling of new lips.
<br>Now tell me, could you softly play a tune,
<br>A nocturne on a pipe of flowing drains?
<br><br>What’s wrong here
<br>Predictable da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM
<br>Verbs softened (blurred, showed, play a tune)
<br>Syntax smoothed into literary English
<br>The challenge turns into a gentle invitation
<br>This poem could be read sitting down. That’s for losers and boring middle class goody-goody kids.
<br>
<br>
<br>TONIC version
(Stress-driven, jagged, performative, intentionally uneven)
<br><br>Could you?
<br><br>I-<br>at once—<br> smeared<br>the map<br>of the everyday,
<br>splashing <br>paint <br>from a glass.
<br>I showed—
<br>on a dish 
<br>of aspic—
<br>the slanted 
<br>cheekbones 
<br>of the ocean.
<br>On the scales 
<br>of a tin fish
<br>I read 
<br>the calls
<br>of new lips.
<br>And you—
<br>could you
<br>play
<br>a nocturne
<br>on a flute
<br>of drainpipes?
