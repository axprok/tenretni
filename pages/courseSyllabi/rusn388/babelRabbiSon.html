<h4>Discussion of "The Rabbi's Son."</h4>

<p>
At the beginning of the story “The Rabbi’s Son,” the narrator, addressing Vasily, recalls a Sabbath in the rabbi’s house and the “beautiful face of Ilya, the rabbi’s son, the last prince of the dynasty,” hovering over the Torah, and describes his meeting with the dying Ilya Braslavsky. The story is suffused with tragedy: the death of the last of a great dynasty is felt painfully, like the death of a brother (Abel), and of the entire lineage with him and within him. When Cain killed Abel, his “blood” cried out to God—that is, the blood of all the generations Abel might have begotten. Three times in the story Ilya is called a prince; that is, the речь is of a royal son, as in Hasidic tales.

<p>
The narrator recognizes Ilya when he alone in the crowd reaches out his hand for Trotsky’s leaflet. He is the only one who can read; he stands culturally above the crowd. The narrator hauls the “prince who has lost his trousers” into the railcar. When he lies there like Noah, naked, then—like Ham—“the young women, planting their crooked legs on the floor like artless females, dryly observed his genitals, that puny, curly manhood of an emaciated Semite.” In this image, the end of the line is once again underscored.

Ilya’s paltry possessions consist of a mixture of communist propaganda and great ancient Hebrew texts. He speaks briefly and in a bookish manner:
</p>
<p>
“A mother in the revolution is an episode.
My letter has come—the letter B.”
</p>
<p>
Nachman of Bratslav has a tale, “About a Certain Rabbi and His Only Son,” in which the son, the heir of the line, dies without fulfilling his purpose—as a result of the interference of an unclean force. One can compare that evil force with the revolution that kills Ilya Braslavsky.
</p>
<p>
The grave of the righteous Nachman of Bratslav is in Uman. To this day it remains a place of pilgrimage for Hasidim. One of the purposes of visiting the grave is to pray for the gift of a child.
</p>
<p>
In the final words of the story—“I received the last breath of my brother”—there sounds a biblical lament and a curse upon fratricidal war.
