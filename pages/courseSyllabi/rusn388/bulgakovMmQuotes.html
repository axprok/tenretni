        <p>
        “Love leaped out at us from behind a corner, like a murderer in an alley, and struck us both at once!”
        <br>The speaker is Master.
        <br>The metaphor emphasizes the suddenness, violence, and inevitability of love in the novel. It is not gentle or gradual, but overwhelming.
        </p>

        <p>
        “Manuscripts don’t burn.”
        <br>In Russian:
