        <h4><i>Master and Margarita</i>.  Famous Quotes</h4>

        <p>
        “Love leaped out at us from behind a corner, like a murderer in an alley, and struck us both at once!”
        <br>The speaker is Master.
        <br>The metaphor emphasizes the suddenness, violence, and inevitability of love in the novel. It is not gentle or gradual, but overwhelming.

        Woland: “Never ask for anything, and especially from those who are stronger than you. They’ll make the offer themselves, and give everything themselves.” (282)
        Power gives; the weak ask.

        <p>
        “Manuscripts don’t burn.” (287)
        <br>In Russian:
        <br>«Рукописи не горят.»
        <br>Woland says it when he returns the Master’s destroyed novel to him.
        <br>Symbolically, it means: True art cannot be annihilated. Truth survives attempts at censorship.
