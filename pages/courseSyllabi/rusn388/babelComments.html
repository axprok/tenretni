<h4>Discussion of "Gedali," "Rabbi," "Rabbi's Son."</h4>



<p>Discussion of "Gedali"
	<br>
	Three Stories by Babel — “Gedali,” “The Rabbi,” and “The Rabbi’s Son”



These three stories, scattered through the collection Red Cavalry, could have been a single work. They are linked by shared characters, Jewish themes, and by the fact that one continues another.
</p>

<p>

In the first, “Gedali,” we see the narrator-hero engaged in a kind of quest: he is searching for the “Sabbath.”
</p>

<p>
The story opens with memories of the Sabbath in the home of the narrator’s grandfather and grandmother. The celebration of the Sabbath is placed in the past—from which the hero has drifted away and which he recalls with sadness. The grandfather sits bent over volumes of Ibn Ezra; that is, by Jewish standards he is an educated man.
</p>

<p>
Abraham Ibn Ezra (1093–1167) was born in Spain and, after the collapse of the Cordoban Caliphate and the onset of persecutions of the Jews, spent his life wandering and in poverty. He wrote of himself that “all his possessions were the clothes on his back, a beggar’s bag with an astrolabe, a brave heart, and the spirit of God within him.” Most likely, the astrolabe among Ostap Bender’s belongings is a reference to Ibn Ezra.
</p>

<p>
Ibn Ezra also wrote wittily about himself: “If I were to decide to become a gravedigger, people would stop dying.” He was a mathematician who introduced the decimal system and the notation of zero.

Among other things, he wrote The Book of Judgments of the Stars and was an astrologer. To earn a living, Ibn Ezra engaged in predicting the lives of boys (!).

During his wanderings through a dead city, in the spirit of Ibn Ezra’s own travels, the hero comes upon a magical antiquarian shop with a small, slightly blind owner named Gedali—ironically derived from the Hebrew word gadol, meaning “great.” This mystical philosopher of life, in the story “The Rabbi,” becomes his guide to the rabbi’s house in the search for the Sabbath.
</p>

<p>
Gedali is dressed like a wizard: in a long green frock coat reaching to the floor, a top hat, and smoky glasses. He listens to invisible voices, thus foreshadowing the journey into the mysterious world of the Jewish Sabbath. As he speaks, he envelops the hero with silken straps—the Jews’ prayer straps—and reflects on good and evil, the eternal principles of the world. The imagery and atmosphere of the story are thoroughly fairy-tale-like. His speech is allegorical and figurative. He studied the Talmud, which in ancient Hebrew sounds like an alliteration, since Talmud is derived from the root lamed (“to learn”), and in the past tense one says lamadti Talmud (“I studied the Talmud”).
</p>

<p>
Gedali loves the commentaries of Rashi. There is a legend about Rashi’s birth that he was granted in exchange for a precious stone that his father threw into the sea so that it would not be used to adorn an icon. And when his mother felt the onset of labor while in the street, a wall parted, forming a niche around her.
</p>

<p>
Rashi is an acronym for Rabbenu Shlomo Yitzhaki (1040–1105). He lived in Troyes, the capital of the County of Champagne, and earned his living making wine. He created great commentaries on the Torah, which by then had already become difficult to understand, translating many words into the contemporary spoken French of his time. This made the text accessible to his contemporaries, and moreover the commentary remains almost the only surviving source of Old French.
</p>

<p>
Gedali loves the books of Maimonides. Maimonides, or Rambam—Rabbenu Moshe ben Maimon (1138–1204)—was born in Córdoba. In 1148 he was forced to flee with his family to Fez because of the persecution of Jews. For many years he wrote books with the material support of his brother David, who traded in precious stones. In 1169 his brother died in a shipwreck, and Moshe was left without support. He fell into such a terrible depression that he could not get out of bed for a year; when he recovered, he began studying medicine and became a famous physician. Because of his service at court, he was forced to convert to Islam, but he continued to be a Jew in secret. Maimonides wrote The Epistle of Consolation to the Converts and The Epistle on (Forced) Apostasy. Unlike Rashi, he denied the scientific value of astrology. It is said of Maimonides: “From Moses to Moses there was none like Moses”—that is, there was no Moses from Moses (the prophet) to Moses (Maimonides). Rambam formulated the thirteen principles of Judaism.
</p>

<p>
Gedali sees no difference between the evil of the past and the evil of the present. He wants a good International. The hero, whose pseudonym is Lyutov, clearly revels in evil and is its bearer. He speaks like a bandit, luxuriating in evil: “We will slash open the eyes that have closed,” “He is eaten with gunpowder and seasoned with the finest blood,” he says of a “retired God.”
<br>
<br>
And Gedali goes off to pray, leaving him behind.

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p><b>Discussion of "the Rabbi"</b>
<br>
In the story “The Rabbi,” Gedali utters a prophetic statement about Hasidism, comparing it to the memory of one’s mother. “The memory of one’s mother nourishes compassion within us.” The word compassion—rachamim—literally means “to take into the bosom, into the womb, where it is warm and comfortable and where the mother’s blood nourishes you.” In this, the wise Gedali sees the appeal of Hasidism. “With its eye sockets drained, Hasidism still stands at the crossroads of the winds of history.” An evil revolution, of course, is incompatible with mercy.
</p>

<p>

Gedali serves as both a spiritual and a physical guide: he leads the hero to Rabbi Motale, “the last rabbi of the Chernobyl dynasty.” The rabbi’s surname, Braslavsky, undoubtedly alludes to the famous Nachman of Bratslav, a Hasidic rabbi and writer. Nachman of Bratslav said, “Now is the time to tell stories.” He also said of one of his tales: “There is not a single word in it that is devoid of meaning. Only one who has grasped the wisdom of the holy books can understand the hints contained in it.” Is this attitude toward the text not a key to Babel? Generations of Jewish children grew up in homes where these tales were read; of course Babel was familiar with them. Nachman of Bratslav had no heir—the son in whom he placed great hopes died.
</p>

<p>
The surname of the Chernobyl rabbis was Twersky, so what we see here is a composite rabbi, who also combines features of Rabbi Borukh of Medzhybizh. On the way to the rabbi’s “court,” the narrator sees two pregnant Ukrainian peasant women—the embodiment of “mercy.” The rabbi’s house is shattered, like the “edifice of Hasidism” of which Gedali speaks. In this dead house sits the rabbi, wearing a royal sable hat and a white robe. On white, dirt would be especially visible—but there is none. The rabbi’s clothing is clean, as befits a man who studies sacred books.
</p>

<p>
The rabbi greets the visitor with closed eyes: “Where has the Jew come from?”—that is, he sees people with inner vision. Of the great progenitor of Hasidism, Baal Shem Tov, it was said that with his spiritual eye he saw everything that was happening in the world from one end to the other. Learning that the visitor is from Odessa, the rabbi calls it “the well of our calamities.” The reference is likely to the pit into which the brothers threw Joseph before selling him into slavery—that is, to the betrayal by brothers.
</p>

<p>
Asked what he does, the visitor deceives the rabbi: “I versify the adventures of Hersh of Ostropol.” He wants to gain the rabbi’s trust and tempts him with the name of the famous Hersh. Hersh of Ostropol was a jester and conversational partner at the court of Rabbi Borukh of Medzhybizh. Borukh, the grandson of the Baal Shem Tov, was not only the spiritual leader of the community but also fabulously wealthy and lived like a king, riding through the town in a splendid carriage. Dozens of servants and cooks lived at Rabbi Borukh’s court. When receiving guests, he sat in a special hall on a throne. Joy is a commandment of Hasidism, yet Rabbi Borukh suffered bouts of black melancholy, and only Hersh was able to dispel it.

Hersh came from a rabbinical family and was educated, but lack of means prevented him from continuing his studies and becoming a rabbi. His learning nevertheless made him a worthy interlocutor for Rabbi Borukh.

At the same time, Hersh is a folk character, like Hodja Nasreddin—a poor man who mocks greedy rich men and secures his livelihood through cunning.

At Rabbi Motale’s “court” lives the jester Reb Mordkhe (perhaps an allusion to Mordecai at the court of Ahasuerus), a hunchbacked little old man with everted eyelids (damage to the eyes!), reminiscent of the jesters in Velázquez. And when the rabbi says, “Let him drink wine, if they give him wine,” the jester echoes: “Drink the wine that they will not give you.”

This may hint that the narrator says he does things he does not in fact do. Moreover, it is in the spirit of a tale by Nachman of Bratslav, the great-grandson of the Baal Shem Tov—The Wise Man and the Simpleton—where the simpleton, who is in fact a philosopher of life, eats meat he does not have and praises it. The jester’s remark about impoverished sages is in the same vein.

The court of the impoverished king consists of madmen, liars, and gawkers. Suddenly the narrator notices a young man with the face of Baruch Spinoza; he is smoking. He is the rabbi’s son.

Baruch—Benedict Spinoza (1632–1677), the great rationalist philosopher, broke with Judaism and was baptized, though apparently he was an atheist. He smoked a great deal, as did Ilya Braslavsky, believing it would cure him of tuberculosis, from which he suffered for many years and of which he died young.

The jester Mordkhe calls Ilya a cursed son. In a tale by Nachman of Bratslav, “How the King’s Daughter Was Lost,” the king curses his daughter: “Ah, may the unclean one take you,” and she disappears—the unclean spirit takes her. Thus the character of the son is described and a foreshadowing is given.

After the celebration of the Sabbath—the day given for rest—the narrator leaves for his agit-train to work on an unfinished article, violating the Sabbath.
