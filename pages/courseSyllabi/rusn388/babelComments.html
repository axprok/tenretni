<h4>Discussion of "Gedali," "Rabbi," "Rabbi's Son."</h4>



<p>Discussion of "Gedali"
	<br>
	Three Stories by Babel — “Gedali,” “The Rabbi,” and “The Rabbi’s Son”



These three stories, scattered through the collection Red Cavalry, could have been a single work. They are linked by shared characters, Jewish themes, and by the fact that one continues another.
</p>

<p>

In the first, “Gedali,” we see the narrator-hero engaged in a kind of quest: he is searching for the “Sabbath.”
</p>

<p>
The story opens with memories of the Sabbath in the home of the narrator’s grandfather and grandmother. The celebration of the Sabbath is placed in the past—from which the hero has drifted away and which he recalls with sadness. The grandfather sits bent over volumes of Ibn Ezra; that is, by Jewish standards he is an educated man.
</p>

<p>
Abraham Ibn Ezra (1093–1167) was born in Spain and, after the collapse of the Cordoban Caliphate and the onset of persecutions of the Jews, spent his life wandering and in poverty. He wrote of himself that “all his possessions were the clothes on his back, a beggar’s bag with an astrolabe, a brave heart, and the spirit of God within him.” Most likely, the astrolabe among Ostap Bender’s belongings is a reference to Ibn Ezra.
</p>

<p>
Ibn Ezra also wrote wittily about himself: “If I were to decide to become a gravedigger, people would stop dying.” He was a mathematician who introduced the decimal system and the notation of zero.

Among other things, he wrote The Book of Judgments of the Stars and was an astrologer. To earn a living, Ibn Ezra engaged in predicting the lives of boys (!).

During his wanderings through a dead city, in the spirit of Ibn Ezra’s own travels, the hero comes upon a magical antiquarian shop with a small, slightly blind owner named Gedali—ironically derived from the Hebrew word gadol, meaning “great.” This mystical philosopher of life, in the story “The Rabbi,” becomes his guide to the rabbi’s house in the search for the Sabbath.
</p>

<p>
Gedali is dressed like a wizard: in a long green frock coat reaching to the floor, a top hat, and smoky glasses. He listens to invisible voices, thus foreshadowing the journey into the mysterious world of the Jewish Sabbath. As he speaks, he envelops the hero with silken straps—the Jews’ prayer straps—and reflects on good and evil, the eternal principles of the world. The imagery and atmosphere of the story are thoroughly fairy-tale-like. His speech is allegorical and figurative. He studied the Talmud, which in ancient Hebrew sounds like an alliteration, since Talmud is derived from the root lamed (“to learn”), and in the past tense one says lamadti Talmud (“I studied the Talmud”).
</p>

<p>
Gedali loves the commentaries of Rashi. There is a legend about Rashi’s birth that he was granted in exchange for a precious stone that his father threw into the sea so that it would not be used to adorn an icon. And when his mother felt the onset of labor while in the street, a wall parted, forming a niche around her.
</p>

<p>
Rashi is an acronym for Rabbenu Shlomo Yitzhaki (1040–1105). He lived in Troyes, the capital of the County of Champagne, and earned his living making wine. He created great commentaries on the Torah, which by then had already become difficult to understand, translating many words into the contemporary spoken French of his time. This made the text accessible to his contemporaries, and moreover the commentary remains almost the only surviving source of Old French.
</p>

<p>
Gedali loves the books of Maimonides. Maimonides, or Rambam—Rabbenu Moshe ben Maimon (1138–1204)—was born in Córdoba. In 1148 he was forced to flee with his family to Fez because of the persecution of Jews. For many years he wrote books with the material support of his brother David, who traded in precious stones. In 1169 his brother died in a shipwreck, and Moshe was left without support. He fell into such a terrible depression that he could not get out of bed for a year; when he recovered, he began studying medicine and became a famous physician. Because of his service at court, he was forced to convert to Islam, but he continued to be a Jew in secret. Maimonides wrote The Epistle of Consolation to the Converts and The Epistle on (Forced) Apostasy. Unlike Rashi, he denied the scientific value of astrology. It is said of Maimonides: “From Moses to Moses there was none like Moses”—that is, there was no Moses from Moses (the prophet) to Moses (Maimonides). Rambam formulated the thirteen principles of Judaism.
</p>

<p>
Gedali sees no difference between the evil of the past and the evil of the present. He wants a good International. The hero, whose pseudonym is Lyutov, clearly revels in evil and is its bearer. He speaks like a bandit, luxuriating in evil: “We will slash open the eyes that have closed,” “He is eaten with gunpowder and seasoned with the finest blood,” he says of a “retired God.”
<br>
<br>
And Gedali goes off to pray, leaving him behind.
