        <h4>Master and Margarita. Modernist Narration</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Modernist narration in Bulgakov’s novel is fragmented, unreliable, and self-reflexive.</li>

                <li>Bulgakov’s narrative stance includes carnivalistic elements: characters-buffoons, characters-wise madmen, misalliance of the profane and the sacred (setting, characters, narration (Woland [Satan] narrates the Gospel), inversion of hierarchy (the novel opens with the “de-crowning of the king” (Berlioz, the head of Writers’ Union, Massolit, literally loses his head), transitional space (Apartment #50).  Violence in Bulgakov’s writing is part of carnivalistic transgression.</li>

                <li>Bulgakov’s narration combines grotesque buffoonery with philosophical parables about treason, moral choice, moral ambiguity, sin, and forgiveness.</li>

                <li>His characters are often artists or writers.  
                The writer (Master, Woland, Ivan) is a cultural hero who can be granted peace and forgiveness for his sins because of his talent.
                In his 1930s works, the major theme is the tragic fate of a writer-genius.</li>

                <li>Female characters: Margarita is a misalliance character (a witch and a savior).  See a similar character in Dostoevskii’s Crime and Punishment (Sonia is a saint and a harlot).</li>
