<ul>
	
	<li>Persona Narration: The narrator is usually not the author, but a specific character with limited, yet unique, perspectives.</li>
	<li>often a first-person narrator who uses distinctive, oral speech patterns—including dialect, slang, and/or unique idiom</li>
	<li>"Double-Voiced" Discourse: Coined by Bakhtin, this technique highlights a tension between the author's intent and the narrator's specific, often uneducated or colorful voice. 
	<br>
	<br>For example, D-503 writes as a devoted citizen of  OneState.  The author of the novel obviously has a very different pov on the life in  OneState. D-503 is a skaz-style narrator (he uses his future era language (no humor, the word "yuny" (7), no word "my" in the future (7)))</li>
