            <li>February 12, 5pm., MacKenzie Theater at Swem Library
                <br>TITLE: The Russian Invasion of Ukraine in Shanson Songs
                <br>GUEST SPEAKER: Prof. Anastasia Gordienko (U. of Arizona)
                <br>Grounded in the criminal song (blatnaia pesnia) canon, 
                <br>the popular musical genre now called the shanson (the Russian underworld song) 
                <br>has not lacked political sentiments since it came out of the shadows in the early 1990s. 
                <br>Perhaps predictably, the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has engendered a strong, 
                <br>almost unanimous, support among Russian shansonniers. 
                <br>This talk focuses mainly on their reaction <br>to the full-scale
                    <br>in songs and interviews, social media posts, 
                    <br>while also analyzing shanson lyrics related to the war and examining the themes 
                    <br>that both this
                    genre and Russian propaganda 
                    <br>consistently exploited long before the full-scale invasion.
