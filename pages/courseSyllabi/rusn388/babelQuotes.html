        <h4> 
            Isaac Babel (1894-1940).  Quotes for Id and Analysis.
        </h4>

<p>
Quote 1:“Who is going to tell me which is the Revolution and which the counterrevolution?...all of us learned men fall to the floor and shout with a single voice, “Woe unto us, where is the sweet Revolution?” (Babel 186-187)  The quote is from the story titled "Gedali."  
</p>

<p>
Meaning of the quote above.
<br>
The question, “Which is the Revolution and which the counterrevolution?” expresses deep uncertainty. In official Bolshevik ideology, the Revolution was supposed to represent justice, liberation, and historical progress. But in Babel’s stories, violence, cruelty, and chaos are committed by all sides — including the Red Army itself. The narrator can no longer distinguish between liberator and oppressor.
<br>Literal Meaning of Gedali ("God is Great"): Derived from the Hebrew phrase gadal yah ("Yahweh is great" or "God has magnified"), the name emphasizes a life anchored in faith, tradition, and divine providence, which sets Gedali apart from the atheistic, violent ideology of the Bolshevik soldiers.
Symbol of Old World Wisdom & Tradition: Gedali is portrayed as a fragile shopkeeper dealing in "dead butterflies" and items of the past. As a character, he represents the traditional Jewish culture, faith, and humanity that are being destroyed by the "new" world of the Revolution.
<br>
Voice of Moral Ambiguity: Gedali serves as the conscience of the story. While he acknowledges the ideals of the revolution, he highlights its human cost, famously asking, "Where is the revolution... and where is the counter-revolution?" and arguing that "good people don't kill".

Quote 2. The quartermaster stopped, and suddenly, smiling guiltily, said, “You see we have a thing about spectacles here, there ain’t nothing you can do! A man of high distinguishings they’ll chew up and spit out — but ruin a lady, yes, the most cleanest lady, and you’re the darling of the fighters!”
</p>

<p>
Quote 3. I caught the goose and forced it to the ground, its head cracking beneath my boot, cracking and bleeding. Its white neck lay stretched out in the dung, and the wings folded down over the slaughtered bird … 
<br>Six of us slept there warming each other, our legs tangled, under the holes in the roof which let in the stars.
I dreamed and saw women in my dreams, and only my heart, crimson with murder, screeched and bled.
</p>

<p>

<br>The passage above is from <i>Red Cavalry</i> by Isaac Babel, specifically from the story “My First Goose.”
<br>
<br>A possible interpretation of the quote above.

<br>The narrator is an intellectual supporting communist revolution newly attached to the Red Cavalry during the Polish–Soviet War (1920-21). He feels alienated among the rough Cossack soldiers, who mock him for his education and softness. 
<br>In order to gain their respect, he violently kills a peasant woman’s goose—an act of gratuitous brutality.
</p>

<p>Beauty and brutality Juxtaposed
<br>“Its white neck lay stretched out in the dung…”
<br>Babel contrasts:
<br>White neck:purity, innocence
<br>Dung, blood, cracking skull: filth, violence, degradation
<br>This imagery reflects the moral corruption produced by war. The purity of the goose mirrors the narrator’s former moral sensibility—now trampled. The narrator kills his own identity into order to join the community of violent warriors.
</p>

<p>Modernist identity: 
<br>crisis and split: the narrator joined the warrior community but never fully reconciled with himself, feeling remorse for the murder of his first victim.
