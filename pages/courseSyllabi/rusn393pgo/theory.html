<h4>Theoretical frames</h4>

<ul>
<li>Halford Mackinder's notion of <b>geopolitics</b>, 
<br>British imperialist geographer from early 1900s.
<br>
<a href="https://iges.ba/en/geopolitics/mackinder-who-rules-eastern-europe-rules-the-world/">Why Eastern Europe matters?</a> 
</li>

<li>
Richard Pipes' notion of <b>patrimonial state</b>.  
<br>
"A regime where the rights of sovereignty and those of ownership blend to the point of being indistinguishable, and political power is exercised in the same manner as economic power" (Richard Pipes. <i>Russia under the Old Regime</i>, 1974, p. 22)
<br>
Pipes served as President Reagan's advisor, the same Reagan who won the Cold War.

<li>

<li><b>Orientalism</b> as empire's knowledge.
<br>
Edward Said contends that Orientalism in literature and media refers to the presentation of Asian and North African cultures through a Western perspective. Orientalism generally emphasizes exoticness and otherness, and often employs tropes of ancient wisdom, sexuality, and mystery to do so.

</li>


<li>Nation. 
Benedict Anderson argues "regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation that may prevail in each, 
<br>
the <b>nation</b> is always conceived as a deep, horizontal comradeship. Ultimately it is this fraternity that makes it possible, over the past two centuries, for so many millions of people, not so much to kill, as willingly to die for such limited imaginings" (6 <i>Imagined Communities</i>).
</li>


</ul>
