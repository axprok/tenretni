Russian 397: Major Works of Fyodor Dostoevsky
</h4>

<p>
<b>Description:</b>

In the absence of a developed public sphere, literary fiction in Russia has always been more than imaginative writing; it has also functioned as a social critic, a platform for philosophical debates, and as a political weapon.  Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky is one of the best-known writers-philosophers whose works had great impact on Friedrich Nietzsche, Franz Kafka and French Existentialists, among many others. An avid reader of contemporary press, Dostoevsky used real criminal cases and political scandals for his narratives.  He was an important voice in Russia warning about the dangers of political extremism and terrorism.

<p> 
In this course, we will consider some of the social, psychological, political, philosophical, and religious questions that tortured Dostoevsky: rationalism, nihilism and the critique of Western social theories; disintegration of traditional family; guilt, punishment, and redemption; the relationship between religion, morality, and the legal system, etc. We will discuss and compare ideology and narrative strategies of Dostoevsky’s Notes from Underground, and three of his famous novels: Crime and Punishment, Demons and The Brothers Karamazov.  While the primary goal of the course is the discussion of literary texts, we will also1) examine cultural and political context of Dostoevsky’s works, in particular the shift from romantic liberalism of the 1840s to the nihilism and terrorism of the 1860s-70s; 2) explore different approaches to the study of literature, including structuralism, narrative theory, Mikhail Bakhtin’s “dialogical” approach, and ideological criticism; 3) watch several films and TV shows to see how Dostoevsky’s characters and ideas influenced twentieth- and twenty-first-century culture.
