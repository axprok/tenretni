<h3>Soviet Nationality Policy (Terry Martin's article)</h3>

<p>
Soviet policy was original in that it supported the national forms of minorities, rather than majorities. It decisively rejected the model of the nation-state and replaced it with a plurality of nation-like republics. The Bolsheviks attempted to fuse the nationalist's demand for national territory, culture, language, and elites with the socialist's demand for an economically and politically unitary state. In this sense, we might call the Bolsheviks internationalist nationalists. (Martin "An Affirmative Action Empire" 76)

<ul>
<li>Soviet affirmative action policy included 4 principles: 1. educating local elites, 2. creating national autonomies, 3. promoting national ids (music, literature, cinema, etc.), 4. the Greater Danger Principle (downplaying the role of the former colonial master nation) (Martin 80-81)</li>

<li>Communist party assumed leadership over the usual process of national formation and took positive action to construct Soviet international nations (nations in form not content) that would accept the formation of a unitary, centralized Soviet state. (Martin "An Affirmative Action Empire" 78-79)</li>
