<h3>Soviet National Policy (Terry Martin's article)</h3>

<p>
Soviet policy was original in that it supported the national forms of minorities, rather than majorities. It decisively rejected the model of the nation-state and replaced it with a plurality of nation-like republics. The Bolsheviks attempted to fuse the nationalist's demand for national territory, culture, language, and elites with the socialist's demand for an economically and politically unitary state. In this sense, we might call the Bolsheviks internationalist nationalists. (Martin "An Affirmative Action Empire" 76)
