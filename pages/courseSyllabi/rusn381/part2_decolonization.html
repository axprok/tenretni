    <h3>What is decolonization?</h3>


    <p>
    Decolonization is the process by which colonies gain independence from colonial rule and become self-governing. It often involves political, economic, and cultural shifts to remove the influence of the colonizing power.

    <p>Dane Kennedy talks about 4 waves of decoloniaztion.  He also argues that the nation state emerged as a major alternative to the empires as polities based on traditional legitimacy, hierarchies of imperial subjects, and colonialism.</p>

    <p>In <i>Imagined Communities</i>, Benedict Anderson defines nation as the following: "regardless of the actual inequality and exploitation that may prevail in each, the nation is always conceived as a deep, horizontal comradeship. Ultimately it is this fraternity that makes it possible, over the past two centuries, for so many millions of people, not so much to kill, as willingly to die for such limited imaginings."</p>
