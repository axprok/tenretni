<p>
The 2019 Lithuanian film <i>Isaac</i> (Izaokas), directed by Jurgis Matulevičius, explores themes of guilt, memory, and historical trauma, particularly in the context of Lithuania’s Nazi occupation and Soviet rule. The film is based on a short story by Antanas Škėma and revolves around the Kaunas massacre of 1941, when pro-German Lithuanian nationalists killed more than 50 Jewish men at the Lietūkis Garage.

<p>
<i>Isaac</i> adapts noir devices to explore Lithuania’s painful history under fascist and Soviet rule. This creates a unique hybrid: a historical-political noir that uses the genre's tools to critique complicity and memory.

<br>
For example, later in the film, Andrius returns alone to the site of the Lietūkis garage massacre, the place where he witnessed—or participated in—the killing of Isaac, a Jewish prisoner.
