<h4>Isaac (dir. , 2019))</h4>

<p>
The 2019 Lithuanian film Isaac (Izaokas), directed by Jurgis Matulevičius, explores themes of guilt, memory, and historical trauma, particularly in the context of Lithuania’s Nazi occupation and Soviet rule. The film is based on a short story by Antanas Škėma and revolves around the Kaunas massacre of 1941, when Nazi collaborators executed thousands of Jews at the Lietūkis Garage.
