<figcaption>Clip.2 - composer Vasilii Agapkin. <i>Farewell of a Slavic Woman</i> (1912).  How is this partiotic march used by the filmmaker Sergei Bodrov in his film <i>Prisoner of the Mountains</i> (1996)?  How does the song interact with the mise-en-scene?  Does the patriotic echo the mise-en-scene? clash with the way characters feel?  How is editing used?  Why does the filmmaker cut to the close-up of characters (Ivan and Sasha) being chained to each other?  What is the role of indigenous people/their country in this scene?</figcaption>
