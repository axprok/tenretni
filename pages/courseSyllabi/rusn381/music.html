<figcaption>Clip.2 - composer Vasilii Agapkin. <i>Farewell of a Slavic Woman</i> (1912).  How is this partiotic march used by the filmmaker Sergei Bodrov in his film <i>Prisoner of the Mountains</i> (1996)?  How does the song interact with the mise-en-scene?  Does the patriotic echo the mise-en-scene? clash with the way characters feel?  How is editing used?  Why does the filmmaker cut to the close-up of characters (Ivan and Sasha) being chained to each other?  What is the role of indigenous people/their country in this scene?</figcaption>

<figcaption>Clip.3 - Ukrainian patriotic song "Oi u luzi chervona kalyna" (Ой у лузі червона калина / Oh, the Red Viburnum in the Meadow) arranged by Tomas Dičiūnas and performed by Lithuanian National Opera singers Viktorija Miškūnaitė, Monika Pleškytė, Rafailas Karpis, Edgaras Davidovičius, Jonas Sakalauskas, Arminas Skirvainis, Paulius Prasauskas and Ukrainian musician Andriy Khlyvnyuk.

<p>For clip 3.  Discuss the significance of the event.  Why do Lithuanian National Opera singers perform the song in Vilnius in 2022?  What connections do the Lithuanian performers make b. their national history and the current events in Ukraine?  How do they use the mise-en-scene and editing to convey their values?  Why do you think the events in Ukraine have a special meaning for the Lithuanians?  What does Žalgiris mean in English?  What battle central for Lithuanian and Polish histories does this place invoke?  Why do you think Soviet Lithuanians named their basketball club Žalgiris?  Where did we see the footage from Lithuanian revolution in this course (which film)?</p>

<p>note to myself: Maybe a question about the Grateful Dead</p>
