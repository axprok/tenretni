A<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1311dqXVnS957agNiv-zV6hxoGjTR2cdd/view?usp=sharing">clip</a> from <i>Brother</i> (1997) depicting St. Petersburg as a dystopian ruin of the westernization project.  Bleak urban scape.  All tourist sites depicted from the back: the city is hostile to the lead character.  The city has no skyline, or sky, just stone upper part of the frame burying the lead character alive.  At the heart of it is the residence of a character whose name is German: Lutheran cemetery.
