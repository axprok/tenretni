<h3>Tangerines (dir. Zaza Urushadze, Estonia-Georgia, 2013)</h3>

<p>
Benedict Anderson argues that civic nations are not natural entities but rather social constructs built through shared narratives, symbols, and media. In <i>Tangerines</i>, this concept is explored through the interactions between characters who, despite being on opposing sides of the Georgian-Abkhazian war, form unexpected bonds that challenge their imposed national identities.  <i>Tangerines</i> embodies Anderson’s theory by deconstructing nationalist assumptions and revealing how communities are imagined rather than essential. The film critiques the absurdity of war and bigotry and instead offers a model of a <b>civic nation</b> in Ivo's house.

<p>
A civic nation is a type of nation that is based on shared political values (rule of law, for example), institutions, and legal citizenship rather than ethnicity, culture, or common ancestry. In a civic nation, membership is open (inclusive) to anyone who adheres to the nation’s laws and principles, regardless of their background. This concept is often contrasted with ethnic nationalism, which defines national identity based on shared heritage, language, or ethnicity.

<p>
The civic nation is often contrasted with ethnic nationalism, which defines national identity based on shared heritage, language, or ethnicity. These are important features of the civic nation. (1) Political and Legal Foundation – Membership is based on citizenship and allegiance to a constitution or set of democratic principles rather than ethnic identity. (2) Inclusivity – It allows people of different ethnic, religious, and cultural backgrounds to be part of the nation if they commit to its values. (3) Democratic Ideals – Often linked to liberal democracy, emphasizing human rights, individual freedoms, and the rule of law.
