<h3>Jan Zielonka’s book <i>Europe as Empire: The Nature of the Enlarged European Union</i> (2006)</h3>
<p>
Jan Zielonka’s book <i>Europe as Empire: The Nature of the Enlarged European Union</i> (2006) explores the European Union’s expansion and governance, comparing it to historical empires rather than modern nation-states. He argues that the EU functions more like a neo-medieval empire with overlapping authorities, diverse political structures, and fluid borders rather than a centralized, Westphalian state.
</p>

<p>
Zielonka examines how the EU’s eastward enlargement transformed its nature, incorporating new member states in a way that resembles the expansion of historical empires, where power is decentralized and governance relies on negotiation rather than strict hierarchy. He contrasts this with the idea of the EU as a federal superstate, suggesting that its governance is marked by asymmetry and complexity rather than uniformity.
</p>

<p>
The book ultimately presents the EU as a dynamic, evolving entity that governs through influence rather than direct control, making it more akin to historical empires like the Holy Roman Empire or the Byzantine Empire rather than modern centralized states.
