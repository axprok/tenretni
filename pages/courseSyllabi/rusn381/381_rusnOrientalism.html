<h3>Russian Orientalism</h3>

<p>What is Orientalism?
    <br>
Edward Said <i>Orientalism</i> (1978). (Orient means the East)
academic writings about the Orient created the Orient.
Said claims that Orientalist scholars (area studies) minimize the diversity of Southwest Asian and North African peoples, and turn West/East relations into binaries, in which the West seems culturally superior
</p>

<p>
Edward Said considers Napoleonâ€™s conquest of Egypt (1798) as the beginning of modern Orientalism. He points out that Napoleon did not go to Egypt with his soldiers only, he also took linguists, historians,& anthropologists with him.
