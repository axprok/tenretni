<h4>The Other Dream Team (2012)</h4>

<p>dir. Marius A. Markevičius is a Lithuanian-American director. 

	The documentary combines historical footage with new interviews. 
<br>
	Use of language: the director asked the Lithuanians to speak in English  for the interviews (to market the film globally). But because of the emotional nature of the topic, speaking in their native tongue was easier. 

	<br>  The present and the past: A series of cutaway scenes follows an up-and-coming Lithuanian player, Jonas Valančiūnas, from his native Utena to the 2011 NBA draft. The documentary also shows Arvydas Sabonis being inducted into the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in 2011
