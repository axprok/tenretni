    <h4>Homo Sacer</h4>

    Giorgio Agamben, an Italian philosopher, contends that the reduction of life to 'biopolitics' is one of the main threads of Western modernity. Agamben examines the conception of a homo sacer, the being reduced to 'bare life', that is, a bilogical exsitence of a human deprived of any rights. 

    Agamben notes that bare life refers then to a conception of life in which the sheer biological fact of life is given priority over the way a life is lived, by which Agamben means its possibilities and potentialities. 

    In her article "Russia’s Quiet Other: Dmitrii Mamuliia’s Another Sky and Aleksandr Kott’s The Test," Elina Sattarova discusses Russian films where non-Russian characters are reduced to bare life and silenced as actors in the narrative.
