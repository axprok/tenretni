    <h4>Homo Sacer</h4>

    <p>
    Giorgio Agamben, an Italian philosopher, contends that the reduction of life to 'biopolitics' is one of the main threads of Western modernity. Agamben examines the conception of a homo sacer, the being reduced to 'bare life', that is, a bilogical exsitence of a human deprived of any rights. 

    Agamben notes that bare life refers then to a conception of life in which the sheer biological fact of life is given priority over the way a life is lived, by which Agamben means its possibilities and potentialities. 

    In her article "Russia’s Quiet Other: Dmitrii Mamuliia’s Another Sky and Aleksandr Kott’s The Test," Elina Sattarova discusses Russian films where non-Russian characters are reduced to bare life and silenced as actors in the narrative.

    <p>
    Sergei Loznitsa's film <i>Donbass</i> (2018) visually enacts Agamben’s homo sacer by showing how war and political collapse strip people down to bare life — vulnerable, killable, yet invisible to any form of justice or legitimate power.

    <p>
    The distinction between war and crime dissolves. Militias, politicians, gangsters, and civilians all participate in a system where might makes right. In Agamben's language, the "state of exception" (where normal law is suspended) becomes permanent, turning people into homo sacer — expendable, killable without consequences.

    <p>
    Individuals lose legal protections. Civilians, prisoners, and even soldiers are reduced to bare life. People are humiliated, lynched, or killed in public rituals (like the man accused of being a Ukrainian saboteur tied to a pole and beaten by random passersby). There's no due process; no sovereign guarantees rights — only arbitrary power.
