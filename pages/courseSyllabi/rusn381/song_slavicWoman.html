<p>
How is this partiotic march used by the filmmaker Sergei Bodrov in his film Prisoner of the Mountains (1996)? What is this march about? How does the song interact with the mise-en-scene? Does the patriotic theme echo the mise-en-scene? clash with the way characters feel? How is editing used? Why does the filmmaker cut to the close-up of characters (Ivan and Sasha) being chained to each other? What is the role of indigenous people/their country in this scene?
