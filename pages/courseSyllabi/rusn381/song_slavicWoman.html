   <h4>Slavic Woman's Farewell (Proshchanie slavianki, Прощание славянки)</h4>

<p>
"Slavic Woman's Farewell Song" is a patriotic march written by a Russian officer and composer Vasilii Agapkin in 1912.  He served in Russian imperial army, the Red Army, and as the bandmaster for the band of the NKVD Division.  Originally it was written to recognize Slavic women accompanying their husbands in the First Balkan War of Slavic nations against the Ottoman Empire.  Russia sided with the Slavs.It gained popularity during  WWI and WW2.   In the present-day Russia it is a partiotic march celebrating Russia's might, continuity between Russia not and its imperial legacy.  See the clip below.

<p>
How is this partiotic march used by the filmmaker Sergei Bodrov in his film Prisoner of the Mountains (1996)? What is this march about? How does the song interact with the mise-en-scene? Does the patriotic theme echo the mise-en-scene? clash with the way characters feel? How is editing used? Why does the filmmaker cut to the close-up of characters (Ivan and Sasha) being chained to each other? What is the role of indigenous people/their country in this scene?
