<p>
Cossacks were private warriors who colonized Siberia for Russian tsar as well as for the entrepreneurs who with tsar's approval/license annexed new territories for fur trade and excavation of minerars.  In the early modern era, a big source of revenue was salt. If you ever heard of Beef Stroganoff, the Stroganovs were the merchant family that developed salt mines in Western Siberia and hired cossacks to capture new territories for them.  In 1581 the Stroganovs equipped the expedition of Yermak Timofeyevich, which was to lay the foundation for Russiaâ€™s annexation of Siberia.  These are the events depicted in Surikov's painting.  The artist's ancestors were allegedly among the cossacks who were hired by the Stroganovs and Yermak. <b>Note that Mikhalkov's <i>Barber of Siberia</i> ends in Siberia, an homage to the Mikhalkov clan's ancestry to the empire his clan has been serving for centuries</b>.
