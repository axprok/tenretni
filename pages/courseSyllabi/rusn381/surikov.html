    <h3>Vasily Surikov</h3>

<p>Vasily Surikov is a great grandfather of Nikita Mikhalkov, the director of <i>Barber of Siberia</i> (1999).  In his paintings, he specialized in historical themes.  Surikov was from Siberia, from a cossack family.  </p>

<p>Cossacks were private warriors who colonized Siberia for Russian tsar as well as for the entrepreneurs who with tsar's approval/license annexed new territories for fur trade and excavation of minerars.  In the early modern era, a big source of revenue was salt. If you ever heard of Beef Stroganoff, the Stroganoffs were the merchant family that developed salt mines in Western siberia and hired cossacks to capture new territories for them.</p>
