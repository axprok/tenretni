<h4>Patrimonialism</h4>

<p>
Richard Pipes argued that political power in Russia is "patrimonialist,"" that is as a type of political and economic organization where sovereignty and ownership rights blend to the point of being indistinguishable. In this regime, political power is exercised in the same manner as economic power. Note the lack of separation of political and economic powers.  Private property cannot contrain political power.  Pipes borrows the idea of the patrimonial regime from Max Weber and applies it to the case of Russia.

<p>
Here is how Soviet cinema celebrates patrimonialism.  Stalin-era Sergei Eisenstein's film <i>Ivan the Terrible</i> (Part II, 1945) celebrates the patrimonial ruler. 
<br>
The shot above especially caught my eye; it’s towards the end, with a parade of peasants coming to beg Ivan to return from a self-imposed exile.  The image is admittedly a pretty on-the-nose depiction of someone as being the Father of A Nation, but even I had to admit it’s beautifully set up.

<p>
Joseph Stalin's cultural administrators celebrated Ivan the Terrible as the positive tsar because he was a model ruthless dictator and expanded the empire.  
<br>
However, Stalin disliked Eisenstein's <i>Ivan the Terrible (Part 2)</i>, from which is the frame above (figure 1).  Stalin noted that the film represents tsar Ivan as an undecicive Hamlet-like ruler, rather than as the ruthless autocrat.  Obviously not being the ruthless dictator was a flaw in Stalin-era historical film about model ruler of Russia.  Stalin and his Central Committee banned the film <i>Ivan the Terrible (Part 2)</i> on 5 March, 1946. The film was released in the USSR only five years after Stalin's death in 1958. After the film was banned, the director, Sergei Eisenstein, had a heart attack and passed away in 1948.
