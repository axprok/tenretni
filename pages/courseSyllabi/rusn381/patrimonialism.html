<h4>Patrimonialism</h4>

Richard Pipes argued that political power in Russia is "patrimonialist,"" that is as a type of political and economic organization where sovereignty and ownership rights blend to the point of being indistinguishable. In this regime, political power is exercised in the same manner as economic power. Note the lack of separation of political and economic powers.  Private property cannot contrain political power.  Pipes borrows the idea of the patrimonial regime from Max Weber and applies it to the case of Russia.
