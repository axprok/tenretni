<h3>Ukraine: Nation State and National Cinema </h3>

<ul>
    <li>
Prof. Yekelchyk's talk <a href="381_yekelchyk.html">"Understanding Putin's War on Ukraine"</a>
</li>

<li>

<a href="https://dovzhenkocentre.org/en/">The Oleksandr Dovzhenko National Centre (Dovzhenko Centre)</a> is the largest Ukrainian film archive.  Established in 1994 in Kyiv.
</li>
<li>
Why is <i>Atlantis</i>(2019) a national cinema film? (cf. Bortko's <i>Taras Bulba</i> (2009))
</li>

<li>
    How is war and gender depicted in Atlantis?  (Cf. Taras Bulba) <br>Sergyi and Katia fought in the victorious war of independence against Russia.  Now they work as equals in the Black Tulip Organization recovering and burying bodies of fallen soldiers and form a new family (nuclear and by metonymy the national one).  In cotrast <i>Taras Bulba</i> celelebrates a permanent imperial war and the male community of Russian cossack warriors.  In Taras Bulba, gender is a way to essentialize hieararchy in the nuclear and by metonymy the imperial family.
</li>

<p><b>A possible essay question</b>
    Prof. Yekelchyk argues Russia's war in Ukraine is a colonial war for Russia and a war for independence for Ukrainian nation state.  How does Russia government media use memes in its information war against Ukraine?  The memes are (1) Krymnash ("Crimea is ours"),(2) Russky mir ("Russian World"),(3) Novorossia ("New Russia").  How does Russian state use cinema to prove the point that Ukraine's claims for its territory and historical memory (for example, the Zaporizhian Cossack Host in 16-18 centuries) have no evidence?  In which ways <i>Atlantis</i> is an example of national cinema and <i>Taras Bulba</i> is an example of Russian imperialist cinema?  Give specific examples from specific texts.
