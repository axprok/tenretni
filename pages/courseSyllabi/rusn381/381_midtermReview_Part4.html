<p><b>Possible essay questions</b>
    Prof. Yekelchyk argues Russia's war in Ukraine is a colonial war for Russia and a war for independence for Ukrainian nation state.  How does Russian government media use memes in its information war against Ukraine?  The memes are (1) Krymnash ("Crimea is ours"),(2) Russky mir ("Russian World"),(3) Novorossia ("New Russia").  How does Russian state use cinema to prove the point that Ukraine's claims for its territory and historical memory (for example, the Zaporizhian Cossack Host in 16-18 centuries) have no evidence?  
<br><br>
    In what ways is Valentyn Vasyanovych’s <i>Atlantis</i> an example of Ukrainian national cinema and Vladimir Bortko’s <i>Taras Bulba</i> is an example of Russian imperialist cinema?  Give specific examples from specific texts.  Refer to any two aspects of the film form (narrative, mise-en-scene [setting, props, costumes[uniforms]], sound, shot properties [choice of close-ups and long shots], editing) when you provide specific examples of the differences.
