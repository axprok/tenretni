Why is <i>Atlantis</i>(2019) a national cinema film? (cf. Bortko's <i>Taras Bulba</i> (2009))

    How is war and gender depicted in Atlantis?  (Cf. Taras Bulba) <br>Sergyi and Katia fought in the victorious war of independence against Russia.  Now they work as equals in the Black Tulip Organization recovering and burying bodies of fallen soldiers and form a new family (nuclear and by metonymy the national one).  In cotrast <i>Taras Bulba</i> celelebrates a permanent imperial war and the male community of Russian cossack warriors.  In Taras Bulba, gender is a way to essentialize hieararchy in the nuclear and by metonymy the imperial family.
