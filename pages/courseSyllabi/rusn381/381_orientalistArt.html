 <figcaption>Fig.1 - Vasily Surikov.  Yermak Conquest of Siberia (1895). The Painting describes a 1582 battle of Russian cossacks led by Yermak with local tatars.

 <p>The major reason for Yermak's colonial expedition was fur trade.  Russia was the major fur supplier on the world market until the European colonization of North America. The Russian government received income from the fur trade through two taxes, (1) the yasak (or iasak) tax on natives and (2) the 10% "Sovereign Tithing Tax" imposed on both the catch and sale of fur pelts. Fur was in great demand in Western Europe, especially sable and marten, since European forest resources had been over-hunted and furs had become extremely scarce.
