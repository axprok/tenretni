<h4>Captivity Narrative</h4>

<p>
The trope of a white person being captured and held in captivity by indigenous people (usually considered non-white or uncililized) is a recurring theme in literature and film, often reflecting cultural anxieties, imperialist narratives, and themes of identity transformation. This trope, sometimes called the "captivity narrative," has roots in real historical events but has been highly mythologized.
</p>

<ul>Key ideas
	<li>Survival and Transformation – Captive characters often undergo a transformation, learning to respect indigenous ways and/or resisting them.</li>

<li>"Savage" vs. "Civilized" Dichotomy – portrayals often reinforce racist ideas of indigenous peoples as "savages" in contrast to the supposedly "civilized" white person.</li>

<li>Romanticization – Some versions depict indigenous cultures as noble and free, contrasting with the corruption of the so-called civilized societies (in this case Russia).</li>

<li>Rescue and Escape – A common plot involves the captive either escaping back to "civilization" or being "rescued", reinforcing ideas of white superiority. Sergei Bodrov slighly adjusts this narrative.  The noble savage releases the captive.</li>
