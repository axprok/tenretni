<p>
the Epic Warriors by Vasnetsov became a commom place in Russian popular culture reproduced on carpets, cigarette packs, etc. Aleksei Balabanov uses this image in his Brother.  the Epic Warriors are hanging on the wall next to Sveta's bed.  The warriors are supposed to protect Sveta. It is however a cheap commercial reproduction of Vasnetsov's painting and the Warriors protect nobody.  Sveta is raped by the gangsters in front of the reproduction of the Epic Warriors.
