 <figcaption>Fig.1 - Viktor Vasnetsov.  Epic Warriors (Богатыри 1898). The painting describes three characters from Russian folk epic songs about larger than life warriors.  They epitomize Russian knights in shining armor.  They are of course the invincible protectors of Russian people.

<p>
the Epic Warriors by Vasnetsov became a common place in Russian popular culture reproduced on carpets, cigarette packs, etc. Aleksei Balabanov uses this image in his Brother.  the Epic Warriors are hanging on the wall next to Sveta's bed.  The warriors are supposed to protect Sveta. It is however a cheap commercial reproduction of Vasnetsov's painting and the Warriors protect nobody.  Sveta is raped by the gangsters in front of the reproduction of the Epic Warriors (fig.2).  Danila didn't protet her either (fig.3)
