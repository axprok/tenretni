<h4>Juliet Johnson's notion of "decentering 'a Great Russian' narrative"</h4>

<ul>
<li>not naturalizing a Russian “sphere of influence” or using terminology like the “near abroad” or “former Soviet republic” to characterize the sovereign states that border Russia.</li> 
<li>De-centering Russia also means taking a pluralistic view of the region as a whole, and even questioning whether or not it is in fact a meaningful region.</li> 
<li>“Postcommunist” and “post-Soviet” as descriptors increasingly obscure more than they reveal, implying continuities and similarities that in many cases no longer exist.</li> 
</ul>

<ul>Benedict Anderson's theory of modern nationalism and nation state (1983)
<li>a nation iс a socially-constructed community of citizens who perceive themselves as part of a larger group. Anderson argues that modern nations are recent, dating back to the 18th century.</li>
<li>Nationalism fights divine right and hereditary monarchy</li>
He also argues that nations are not ancient communities united by blood or language (is this a case of modern Ukraine?)</li>
<li>Nation is a horizontal community</li>
<li>Nation is popularly sovereign (ruled by people)</li>
<li>Nation is limited (cf. empire)</li>
</li>
</ul>
