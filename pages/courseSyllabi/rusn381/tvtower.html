<h4>Vilnius TV Tower Events</h4>

<p>
After the Declaration of Restoration of Independence in 1990, Soviets demanded to submit to their authority. Lithuanians ignored those demands and the Soviets sent troops to occupy key buildings in Vilnius killing fourteen protesters in the process.  Lithuanians protested on the streets of their cities and the Soviets had to retreat.
