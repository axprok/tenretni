    <td>What is the essence of Russian identity, according to the film?  Mikhalkov claims it is an essentialist identity: you are born with it and it remains unchaingeable.  You identity as Russian is  innate and consists biologically (or psychologically) based features that never changes. In case of a Russia it is an identity of ever expanding explorer (this is my sarcastic positive spin on the way film portrays it), such as Andrei or Andrew (read the empire builder). In contrast to the West, Russian imperialism does not destroy environment.  In the film, Russia is full of forests, while the West destroys environment.</td>
