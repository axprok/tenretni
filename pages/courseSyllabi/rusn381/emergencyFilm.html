        <h4>The Emergency Film</h4>

<p>
Nancy Condee notes that the Russian emergency film portrays natural and technological disasters to immerse viewers in situations where conventional societal structures are disrupted. This disruption serves to highlight and reinforce traditional patriarchal values, particularly the role of the father figure (a cypher for the state authority) as a stabilizing force during crises. In these narratives, the restoration of order is often depicted through the reestablishment of paternal authority, suggesting that such authority is essential for societal stability in times of emergency.  The emergency film differs from  Hollywood genre of disaster film where individual agency of utmost importance (cited in Cinemasuarus 2020)
