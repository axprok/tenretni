<h3>Patriarchy</h3>

<p>
A society in which political power is maintained by men and is used to repress women, according them a secondary status. A major device of patriarchies is to equate female and feminine in order to make the connection seem natural (i.e., inherent, based on laws of nature), and thus indisputable.
