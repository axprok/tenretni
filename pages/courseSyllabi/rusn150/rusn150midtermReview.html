<h3>1.  Feminist Theory</h3>

<ul><b><a href="rusn150keyterms.html">1.1. Key Terminology</a></b>

<!--
<li>FEMALE – A designation for the biological/anatomical makeup (chromosomes) that endows the individual with vagina, breasts, etc., and the potential to bear children.  Sex–what one indicates on a questionnaire.</li><li>

FEMININITY – a set of externally-defined characteristics (gender) through which cultural and social norms of sexuality are ascribed to women, as the opposite of "masculinity,” which tradition has established as “the norm,” “the primary category”(cf. Hélène Cixous):
</li><li>
BINARISM
Gender binarism is the separation of males and females into two socially and biologically distinct categories that are viewed as opposite from one another and diametrically opposed. Gender binarism involves the assumption that all AMABs are inherently masculine and that all AFABs are inherently feminine. Gender binarism discourages the crossing and mixing of gender roles and gender identities. It reinforces gender-based stereotypes and devalues people with trans, intersex, or nonbinary identities.

</li><li>
FEMINISM -- A political stance that seeks to uncover and discredit the patriarchal prejudices and sexism endemic to social, institutional, and personal power relations between the sexes.  Feminist criticism seeks to expose the ways in which males appropriate certain high-status roles for  themselves, while  relegating females to lower-status roles determined by male-dominated society.  Feminist criticism strives to reveal the bias in supposedly neutral or objective (i.e., naturalized) discourse.
</li><li>
PATRIARCHY – A society in which political power is maintained by men and is used to repress women, according them a secondary status.  A major device of patriarchies is to equate female and feminine in order to make the connection seem natural (i.e., inherent, based on  laws of  nature), and thus indisputable.

</li><li>
SEXISM – The automatic ascription of essential qualities to people solely on the basis of their biological sex.
</li><li>
ESSENTIALISM –From a feminist perspective, the ascription of invariable or essential (in the meaning of "pertaining to the natural essence") traits to men and women without respect to geographic, cultural, or social factors.  The alternative to essentialism is SOCIAL CONSTRUCTIONIST approach to identity (Stuart Hall Representations 25).
</li><li>
PERFORMANCE OF SEXUAL IDENTITY– The idea, popularized by Judith Butler, that each individual repeatedly acts out a sexual identity that is socially constructed according to heteronormativity and urged upon the individual but that no such “core” identity inheres in the individual. 
</li><li>
STATE FEMINISM -- a set of government policies that recognized women’s special needs but viewed them primarily as an additional workforce, with a mandatory second shift on the homefront.  The socialist state, in fact, used soaps to promote an idealized image of a “socialist superwoman” who can do it all both at work and at home, and somehow remain desirable (Aniko Imre, TV Socialism, 214-215).
</li><li>
INTERSECTIONALITY (see the site) -- Intersectionality is a term that was coined by Kimberle Crenshaw in the late 1980s that refers to the concept of intertwining systems of oppressions such as sexism, racism, homophobia, xenophobia, etc. According to this theory, these institutions of oppression cannot be examined individually; one must take all instances of oppression into account in order to fully understand their effects.
</li><li>
CISGENDER CISNORMATIVITY (see the site)
CISGENDER -- is an adjective used to describe someone whose gender identity matches their body and the gender assigned to them at birth-- in other words, someone who is not transgender, non-binary, or intersex. A cisgender person might be an AFAB who identifies as female or an AMAB who identifies as male.  The word was first used in 1995 in "Transsexueller Wunsch und Zissexuelle Abwehr," or "Transsexual Wish and Cissexual Defense," by a German sociologist Volkmar Sigusch.

QUEER THEORY (see the site)



ALLY -- Within the context of progressive culture, an ally is a person who is not a member of an oppressed group but who supports civil rights and social movements associated with that group. An ally acknowledges their position of relative privilege and uses that position to create change within the larger culture and society.

<ul>Important dates: 
<li>
1906 Finland, part of Russian Empire at the time, becomes the first nation to achieve full female suffrage.  Nationalists want only wealthy women to have the right to vote.
