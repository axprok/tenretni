<h3>TERRIBLE PERFECTION</h3>

<p>
Barbara Heldt’s concept of "terrible perfection" comes from her book <i>Terrible Perfection: Women and Russian Literature</i> (1987). Heldt examines how women are represented in Russian literature. The phrase "terrible perfection" reflects the way women are often depicted as models of self-sacrifice and spiritual beauty—images. These portrayals of perfection come at the expense of their individuality and agency.

Heldt argues that such literary portrayals mirror societal expectations for women, especially in patriarchal Russian society. The ideal of the "perfect" woman denies women the complexity, freedom, and humanity--the way men are represented in classical Russian novels.
