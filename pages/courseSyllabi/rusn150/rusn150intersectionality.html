<h3>Intersectionality</h3>

<p>
Intersectionality is a term that was coined by Kimberle Crenshaw in the late 1980s that refers to the concept of intertwining systems of oppressions such as sexism, racism, homophobia, xenophobia, etc. According to this theory, these institutions of oppression cannot be examined individually; one must take all instances of oppression into account in order to fully understand their effects.
