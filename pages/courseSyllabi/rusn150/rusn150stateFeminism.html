<h3>State Feminism</h3>

<p>
<b>State feminism</b> is a set of policies when the state adopts policies that are beneficial to women's rights and the improvement of women's lives.
</p>

<p>
The theory of <b>state feminism</b> originates from Scandinavian countries and their gender egalitarian policies. Norwegian political scientist Helga Hernes coined the term in 1987. During the 1970s and 1980s, Scandinavian feminist organizations successfully appealed to their governments for gender equality. At the same time, many actors pushed for women to enter the work force, leading to a movement of women into the public sphere. Hernes labeled these steps as an approach towards a "women-friendly" state and a "state feminist". Hernes noted that liberal welfare policies combined with high levels of women representation within legislative bodies were defining characteristics of each of these states.

<p>
<b>Illiberal state feminism</b>: a set of government policies that recognized women’s special needs but viewed them primarily as an additional workforce, with a mandatory second shift on the homefront.  The socialist state, in fact, used soaps to promote an idealized image of a “socialist superwoman” who can do it all both at work and at home, and somehow remain desirable (Aniko Imre, <i>TV Socialism</i>, 214-215).
