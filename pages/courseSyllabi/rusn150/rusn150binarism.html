<h3>BINARISM</h3>
<p>
Gender binarism is the separation of males and females into two socially and biologically distinct categories that are viewed as opposite from one another and diametrically opposed. 

</p>
<p>
Gender binarism involves the assumption that all AMABs are inherently masculine and that all AFABs are inherently feminine. Gender binarism discourages the crossing and mixing of gender roles and gender identities. It reinforces gender-based stereotypes and devalues people with trans, intersex, or nonbinary identities.
