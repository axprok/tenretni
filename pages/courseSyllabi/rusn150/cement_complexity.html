    <h4>Gladkov's Cement. Complexity and difference from socialist realism</h4>

    <p><b>Ideological Ambiguity</b>
    <br>
    Gladkov uses Marcus Aurelius as a point of contrast: is the revolutionary hero supposed to patiently endure suffering like a Stoic, or to violently reshape the world like a Bolshevik?
    </p>

    <p><b>Intertextuality</b>
    <br>Invoking Spinoza
    <br>
    Baruch Spinoza (17th-c. Dutch philosopher) stands for rationalism, clarity, and
    <br>an ethical system built not on dogma but on reason.
    <br>
    His Ethics emphasizes necessity: everything in nature follows from immutable laws, and 
    <br>human freedom comes from understanding necessity.

    <br>
    Gladkov’s novel is obsessed with the clash between chaos and order — the chaotic aftermath of the Civil War versus the new “cement” of socialist construction.

    <br>Spinoza (professor Ivan invokes him at p. 182) is invoked as a thinker of rational order. 
    <br>He represents the dream that history, politics, and
    <br>even personal passions can be understood and mastered through reason.
    </p>

    <p>
    Ivan compares himself to blind Oedipus (183)
    <br>The Oedipus reference suggests: revolutionary certainty may conceal a deeper blindness to human costs.
    <br>

    </p>

    <p>The New Economic Policy (210-211)
	Polia and Gleb are wondering whether the Revolution lost 
	<br>its economic war against capitalism
	<br>concession (211)
    </p>

    <p>
        Dasha dedicates herself to the common cause.
        <br>Meanwhile Niura is dying (243-5), dies (262)
        <br>Dasha's choice is NOT presented as unambiguously and ideologically positive.   
    </p>

    <p>Christian symbolism
        <br>Chapter 16 Tares (Chaff vs Wheat) (263-283)
        <br>The Soviet project of industrial and <br>social reconstruction is presented as a kind of “harvest.” 
        <br>In this harvest, true grain represents loyal proletarians and revolutionary energies, <br>while плевелы represent remnants of the old world. (Cf. Matthew 13:24)
