                <br>Gladkov doesn’t just present the event as black-and-white. 
                <br>The scene is uncomfortable: readers are invited to feel Chirsky’s pain even while recognizing the ideological rationale.
                <br>This ambiguity illustrates the human costs of revolution, 
                <br>making the novel more complex than simple propaganda. 
                <br>Under Stalin, this complexity will go away.
