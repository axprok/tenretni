This icon is the oldest image coming from Rus (Ukraine and Russia) (XII c.).

Icons are considered to be miracle-making protective items.

In 1395 the Vladimir Mother of God icon was moved to Moscow to protect the city from Tamerlane's invasion and supposedly it made a miracle.

The icon was then installed in the Uspensky Cathedral (The Dormition of the Mother of God Cathedral) in the Moscow Kremlin where it stayed for centuries later (at the communist revolution in 1917) to be moved to the Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow.

Icons are painted with egg tempera.  It is a permanent, fast-drying painting medium consisting of pigments mixed with a water-soluble medium, usually glutinous material such as egg yolk. Tempera paintings are very long-lasting, and examples from the first century AD still exist. Egg tempera was a primary method of painting until after 1500 when it was superseded by oil painting.

Icons are usually painted on wooden boards.
