<p>
Ludmila Gurchenko is a film actress and pop singer from the Thaw era.
She performed one of the major hits of the Thaw "Five Minutes" (1956). The song is about celebrating the New Year, a non-ideological holiday, vs. May Day Parade, a communist holiday (the ending of Alexandrov's Circus (1936))
Her singing style and theme of her famous song focuses on individual, individual feelings, does not mention Soviet collective, omits any references to communism.  Her costume stands out instead being similar to everyone else.  Cf. with the ending of Grigorii Alexandrov's Circus when everone marches in the same white uniform.
