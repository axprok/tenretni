        Course Description
        This course prepares you for the Summer Study Abroad Program in Vilnius. We will engage in some activities to get to know each other better, discuss W&M policies and protocols for studying abroad, address your concerns regarding an immersion program, and discuss logistical matters. We will also familiarize ourselves with the history, geography, and culture of Lithuania.
        <br>
        Our one-credit course in Vilnius, "Russia in Context," will build on the material covered in this prep-course.
