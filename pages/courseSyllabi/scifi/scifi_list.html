<li>The End of Civilization’ (1984) dir. Piotr Szulkin</li>

</ul>







Stalker (Tarkovsky) 



Solaris (Tarkovsky) 



To The Lake (Netflix) 



Ikarie XB-1 (or Voyage to the End of the Universe - Czech, 1963)



1983 (Holland on Netflix)



Comment: A somewhat sci-fi TV series with more totalitarian undertones. While not as focused on science and technology, the series portrays an alternative reality in which the fall of communism in Poland never happened. Similarly to Sexmission, 1983 asks some serious philosophical questions that again, in the Polish context, cannot escape politics.





Literature



Alexander Bogdanov - Red Star (1908)



Comment: Fun and easy to teach, precisely because he is a bit pedantic about the main points, but read in a contemporary context, very relevant to current ecological/climate change issues.

 

Aleksei Gastev - short prose poem, “We Grow from Iron” (Poeziia rabochego udara, 1918)



Anna Starobinets - Icarus Gland 



Karel Čapek, R.U.R. 



-comment: beware the free online translations; at least one of them is awful): not as much fun to read as it is to discuss after reading



-comment: widely available and is less than 100 pages long; this is the book where the word 'robot' came from



Karel Čapek, War with the Newts 

Comment: now readable as a climate change novel



Karel Čapek - Krakatit



Stanisław Lem - Solaris (1961)



Comment: be sure to use Bill Johnston's translation direct from Polish



Stanisław Lem, The Cyberiad (1965) 



Stanisław Lem The Mask (1974) 



A & B Strugatsky, Escape Attempt



A & B Strugatsky, Far Rainbow



A & B Strugatsky- Monday Begins on Saturday 



A & B Strugatsky- Roadside Picnic ( total winner, students love it)



A & B Strugatsky- Hard to Be a God



Yana Vagner - To the Lake  (pandemic plot)



Viktor Pelevin - OMON Ra



Abram Terz - Phentz 



Ivan Efremov - "Туманность Андромеды



Juliusz Machulski's popular 1983/1984 sci-fi comedy, Sexmission



Comment: It usually works well with students as the plot is easy to follow, viewers cheer for the last two men remaining on the planet, and the film is a parable for the oppressive and ridiculous communist system. Lastly, it is pretty straightforward in comparison to find it with English subtitles, including on easterneuropeanmovies.com.



Vladimir Mayakovsky - The Bedbug
