NEW PROCESS FOR SUBMITTING GRADE CHANGES

We are writing to remind you of incomplete grades (I's) that remain on student records for your courses. At the bottom of this email you will see the students for whom you assigned a grade of I in a previous semester.  Per University policy, students have one semester in which to make up incomplete work in order to receive a letter grade.

NEW!  Beginning this semester, grade completions and corrections will be submitted through a University Registrar webform available to faculty 24/7.

Click the link below to review the instructions and access the webform:
