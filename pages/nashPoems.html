        <h2>Ogden Nash's Poems that I like :)</h2>

        <p>
        <b>The Fly</b>
        <br>
        God in his wisdom made the fly
        <br>
        And then forgot to tell us why.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>I married an April Girl</b> :)
        <br>
        Always Marry an April Girl
        <br>
        Praise the spells and bless the charms,
        <br>
        I found April in my arms.
        <br>
        April golden, April cloudy,
        <br>
        Gracious, cruel, tender, rowdy;
        <br>
        April soft in flowered languor,
        <br>
        April cold with sudden anger,
        <br>
        Ever changing, ever true --
        <br>
        I love April, I love you.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>The Catsup Bottle
        </b>
        <br>
        First a little,
        <br>
        Then a lottle.
        </p>

        <p><b>The Wombat</b>
        <br>
         The wombat lives across the seas,
         <br>
        Among the far Antipodes.
        <br>
        He may exist on nuts and berries,
        <br>
        Or then again, on missionaries;
        <br>
        His distant habitat precludes
        <br>
        Conclusive knowledge of his moods,
        <br>
        But I would not engage the wombat
        <br>
        In any form of mortal combat.
