        <h2>Ogden Nash's Poems that I like :)</h2>

        <p>
        <b>The Fly</b>
        <br>
        God in his wisdom made the fly
        <br>
        And then forgot to tell us why.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>I married an April Girl</b> :)
        <br>
        Always Marry an April Girl
        <br>
        Praise the spells and bless the charms,
        <br>
        I found April in my arms.
        <br>
        April golden, April cloudy,
        <br>
        Gracious, cruel, tender, rowdy;
        <br>
        April soft in flowered languor,
        <br>
        April cold with sudden anger,
        <br>
        Ever changing, ever true --
        <br>
        I love April, I love you.
        </p>

        <p>
        <b>The Catsup Bottle
        </b>
        <br>
        First a little,
        <br>
        Then a lottle.
        </p>
